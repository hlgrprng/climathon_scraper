      "Demand peaks – there are two distinct times of the day – morning and evening – where demand is greatly increased.\n",

      "Isolation and a lack of scale – Alice Springs is a remote town with a small population situated in the centre of Australia. The economies of scale available in large Australian cities are not present in Alice Springs. \n",
      "Low daytime load demand – Alice Springs has recently experienced a new low daytime demand of 8MW. It is forecast that as early as 2023, the Alice Springs daytime load could reach 0MW. This has significant implications for grid stability and security.\n",
      "High level of community support – Alice Springs has a long history of iconic projects and renewable energy initiatives, including through the Alice Solar City program led by Alice Springs Town Council. Alice Springs’ annual renewable energy contribution is currently around 8%, which is higher than the Northern Territory average of 4%.\n",

Athens, a city that suffers from heatwaves, flash floods and poor air quality, has historically wasted, misused and mismanaged its natural resources. It needs a culture change to understand, support, and promote its green infrastructure. The city needs to create, as well as, better manage its green areas. Creating a Tree Inventory is an integral part of Athens Resilience Strategy to integrate natural systems into the urban fabric. An urban tree inventory is the database of accurate information on the health and diversity of an urban green stock.\n",

Copernicus, EMODnet, BlueBRIDGE, FAO, Eurostat, Natura2000 are among the relevant datasets that will be made available to all participants.\n",

They start to demand and take decisions for themselves that support this. Communities that behave in this way also therefore take decisions that reduce climate change.\n",
      "We know that increased wellbeing can have positive impacts on air quality and climate change and that large health inequalities are directly linked to poverty in the city. But sadly, we face some massive challenges to make the connection between wellbeing and the environment - such as the role of the car contributing in part to ¼ of Birmingham children being overweight/obese when they start school (rising to 40% by the time they leave primary school) with over 80% of the population are inactive in the city…\n",

      "Specifically, how can we change Birmingham’s streets and public places to be cleaner, easier to use, enjoy and look at? How can we give our communities a voice to demand or lead positive change about the place they live in, in a practical, environmentally sensitive way?\n",

adelaide01;Adelaide;Circular Economy;How can we unlock the benefits of a circular economy in Adelaide?;circular-economy;Capturing the value of a circular economy approach in Adelaide will require keeping products, components and materials at their maximum utility and value.  Do you have an idea that could be key to unlocking the benefits of a circular economy in Adelaide? Capturing the value of a circular economy approach in Adelaide will require keeping products, components and materials at their maximum utility and value. This means: designing ‘smart’ products that last longer and can be reused many times sharing things more and making repair the norm recycling materials effectively and converting some waste materials into biofuels displacing fossil fuels and derived products with bio-based materials This approach opens the door for entrepreneurs and innovators to transform the way we manage resources and think about waste. Consider the opportunities in reverse logistics, and in services and digital technologies that can help create a circular economy. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/circular-economy/adelaide-challenge

alice-springs01;Alice Springs;Renewable energy;How to utilise the unique characteristics of Alice Springs to incorporate more renewable energy?;energy;" Situated in a hot, arid environment Alice Springs is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.  How can we identify opportunities for Alice Springs to reduce its energy consumption through innovative strategies and reduce our overall energy consumption?  Alice Springs has a number of unique characteristics, which together, affect the town’s ability to incorporate more renewable energy and reduce consumption: Climate – it is hot in Alice Springs and air-conditioning requires significant energy.  Demand peaks – there are two distinct times of the day – morning and evening – where demand is greatly increased. Transient population – according to the NT Planning Commission Alice Springs ‘a transient population has been a general long term trend for Alice Springs’.  Isolation and a lack of scale – Alice Springs is a remote town with a small population situated in the centre of Australia. The economies of scale available in large Australian cities are not present in Alice Springs.  Low daytime load demand – Alice Springs has recently experienced a new low daytime demand of 8MW. It is forecast that as early as 2023, the Alice Springs daytime load could reach 0MW. This has significant implications for grid stability and security. High level of community support – Alice Springs has a long history of iconic projects and renewable energy initiatives, including through the Alice Solar City program led by Alice Springs Town Council. Alice Springs’ annual renewable energy contribution is currently around 8%, which is higher than the Northern Territory average of 4%.  What business or system-wide approaches can we implement to make it easier to reduce our costly reliance on traditional energy generation for Alice Springs as a whole? Potential areas that a Climathon project could tackle are: The split incentives for tenant/landlord solar systems, noting Alice Springs’ high number of residential renters and transient population; Strategies for shifting demand away from early morning/evening, reducing system peaks; Strategies for reducing low daytime demand periods.

ancona01;Ancona;Better air to breathe;How can we help Ancona improve air quality?;air-pollution;Air pollution in Ancona requires innovative solutions for the reduction of contaminants and harmful emissions according to complexity of a Port City considering traffic towards the city, mobility in and out as well as the production of industrial activities.  Air pollution is one of the main environmental and health threats of this era. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) assessment of the burden of disease due to air pollution, more than 2 million premature deaths each year can be attributed to the effects of urban outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution (caused by the burning of solid fuels). WHO believes that reducing levels of one particular type of pollutant (known as PM10) could reduce deaths in polluted cities by as much as 15% every year. The Municipality of Ancona is part of the Italian Network of Healthy Cities promoted by the World Health Organization since 1996, with the adhesion to the aforementioned Network the Municipality of Ancona has decided to reaffirm its role and its commitment to the promotion and protection of health by adopting an inter-sectoral and inter-institutional policy capable of responding to the complexity of the needs that require a high degree of collaboration and integration between the different organizational levels at the local level. The proposed challenge requires 2 inter-connected and related sub-tasks: 1.       Sustainable Urban Mobility in response to air pollution. Making urban mobility more sustainable means to reduce city gas emissions. Indeed being Ancona active in industrial, touristic and commercial assests and hosting the administrative offices of Marche region, the university facilities and the Regional Health Headquarters, the urban mobility of Ancona city is one the main problem for air quality. 2.        Developing integrated solutions for the City Port Ancona is hosting the regional industrial port. A project solution that involves the passenger seaport and freight/cargo area and the industrial area will help Ancona to organize its activities.  ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/air-emissions-reduction-in-the-adriatic-port-city-of-ancona
athens01;Athens;Creating Athens’ first open-data Urban Tree Inventory;How can we create Athens’ first open-data Urban Tree Inventory?;extreme-weather;How can Sustainable Design Principles, Technological Breakthroughs & Innovative Civic Engagement be combined to create Athens’ first open-data Urban Tree Inventory?  A major challenge for cities in the future will be to meet our need for nature based solutions towards a more resilient city that will be able to withstand climate change and environmental challenges. Athens, a city that suffers from heatwaves, flash floods and poor air quality, has historically wasted, misused and mismanaged its natural resources. It needs a culture change to understand, support, and promote its green infrastructure. The city needs to create, as well as, better manage its green areas. Creating a Tree Inventory is an integral part of Athens Resilience Strategy to integrate natural systems into the urban fabric. An urban tree inventory is the database of accurate information on the health and diversity of an urban green stock. How concerned & active citizens of Athens, together with expert arborists & foresters, research students & members of the Academia, IT specialists & software programmers, innovative entrepreneurs & local businesses, design thinking facilitators & community-based organizations, along with city officials, can create an open data Urban Tree Inventory that will provide information for the planning, design, planting, maintenance, removal of community trees as well as civic usage of green spaces? Good tree inventory practice involves integrating sustainable design principles, available advanced technologies such as the use of AI applications, excellent knowledge of urban forestry & civic land use, and innovative community engagement that encompasses collaboration and co-creation between city officials and citizens. Solutions that Climathon Athens 2018 could focus on:• Developing a holistic approach to spatial planning for open green spaces and greener pedestrian streets in the Municipality of Athens. • Enabling mapping and identification of trees in predefined areas to support public awareness and demonstration activities such as labelling, development, maintenance, etc.• Assessing the benefits of trees and open green areas using environmental and socioeconomic indicators (assessing the flooding reduction potential, ecosystem benefits, social benefits, cognitive function of green spaces, shading and cooling, urban heat island effect, landscape enhancement, etc.).• Adapting or creating business models that will support public-private sector collaborations.• Using design and technology to add value and extend the useful life of current public green spaces.• Establishing co-creation opportunities between city officials, citizens, local businesses, research centers & universities.• Enhance and promote public awareness on trees value and importance in the city with any possible ways (e.g. use of technology, stakeholder engagement processes, others). The aim of the Challenge this year is to fuel new thinking, that will ideally include the holistic analysis of satellite, environmental, biological and socio-economic data and the interactions between open green spaces, water attenuation and spatial planning. Copernicus, EMODnet, BlueBRIDGE, FAO, Eurostat, Natura2000 are among the relevant datasets that will be made available to all participants. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/extreme-weather/creating-athens-first-open-data-urban-tree-inventory
bangor01;Bangor;Creating climate change solutions for problems affecting the ecosystem of Gwynedd and Ynys Môn;What’s gone wrong, how can we do better? ;air-pollution;Bangor City and Gwynedd/Ynys Môn form a complex rural and urban ecosystem. Getting to grips with Climate Change is just as complex requiring a lot of collaboration to find solutions.   We have the technology to tackle the causes and effects of climate change, but it’s obvious to everyone that we are not doing a very good job. Yes, we need products, services, business models, platforms and initiatives, to solve climate change problems, but how do people like us get involved? Climathon Bangor is an opportunity to work as a team to devise, develop and pitch workable and practical solutions and have some fun at the same time.. Your TASK will be to form a team to go on a learning and innovation journey for the day. The itinerary for this trip of a lifetime is as follows: Explore the category options, brainstorm and choose the category that most require solutions or are of particular interest to your team. If you have already identified a category, move on to the next stage. Identify what the problem really is. Create a problem statement to focus your thinking. How to solve the problem of x and create a sustainably resourced solution (it might need finance, it might only need human resources, it might need a combination of both). Brainstorm a range of possible solutions and select the two solutions that are most likely to be feasible:  Can we do it, is it viable – can we afford to do it? Is it desirable – will people want this, Is it sustainable – will the solution solve the problem/ meet the environmental benchmarks?  We will talk you through how you can come up with a well thought solution that you can defend You will be able to create a compelling for your idea Develop a 5 minute pitch Pitch Judges assess the case and decide on ‘best’ idea Feedback and prizes  ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/creating-climate-change-solutions-for-problems-affecting-the-ecosystem-of-gwynedd-and-ynys-mon
birmingham01;Birmingham;Find ways to help citizens lead healthier, happier lives;How can we tackle climate change within our poorest communities?;air-pollution;To tackle climate change we need to ensure that everyone, from an 8 year old to an 80 year old has their say about how to create sustainable happy communities.  Our more disadvantaged citizens need to have a say about tackling climate change in the context of their, often difficult, circumstances.   To tackle climate change we need to ensure that everyone, from an 8 year old to an 80 year old has their say about how to create sustainable happy communities.  Our more disadvantaged citizens need to have a say about tackling climate change in the context of their, often difficult, circumstances. If we don’t, most plans will fail. Birmingham is a city of 1.1 million people in the city with 408,000 Birmingham citizens in the top 10% most deprived in England. Measures to reduce air pollution, such as clean air zones, have been found to impact those from the most deprived communities hardest, leading to increased financial pressures and reduced mobility. In addition, Birmingham has one of the worst recycling rates in the country, creating more pressures on our environment. Evidence tells us that living happy, fulfilling lives is about far more than money or economic growth. We know that citizens who are connected with and contribute to their communities and adopt sustainable behaviours like collaborating and sharing are happier. They start to demand and take decisions for themselves that support this. Communities that behave in this way also therefore take decisions that reduce climate change. We know that increased wellbeing can have positive impacts on air quality and climate change and that large health inequalities are directly linked to poverty in the city. But sadly, we face some massive challenges to make the connection between wellbeing and the environment - such as the role of the car contributing in part to ¼ of Birmingham children being overweight/obese when they start school (rising to 40% by the time they leave primary school) with over 80% of the population are inactive in the city… There is much to be done together if we are to make a change. By creating solutions that educate, involve and engage our poorest communities, we have the best chance of creating a city-wide focus on positive impacts for these citizens rather than making them victims of change. We’ve got 3 we want help with! 1 - How can we give Birmingham citizens a chance for longer, happier lives?  What language and actions can we use as citizens to encourage and spread an understanding that real wellbeing comes from caring about your environment, whether that is at a community level or the air you breathe? 2 - How can we make encourage our citizens to feel passionate about the environment they live and work in? Specifically, how can we change Birmingham’s streets and public places to be cleaner, easier to use, enjoy and look at? How can we give our communities a voice to demand or lead positive change about the place they live in, in a practical, environmentally sensitive way? 3 - Lastly, how can we make our city a more healthy, clean and fun place to travel around on a daily basis?  What bothers citizens about waste and dirt? What do they think they can do that that can help tackle climate change with regards energy and fuel consumption, waste and recycling, and what is really achievable in the context of their lives? So, come on, help us. Help take on these challenges and join up, for what’s going to be a life changing day! ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/tackling-climate-change-from-within-birmingham-s-communities-to-create-healthier-places-to-live
bologna01;Bologna;Air quality engagement process;How can we improve urban air quality in Bologna by increasing knowledge and citizens' interaction?;air-pollution;Air quality changes every day, requiring us to adapt our actions and habits. Be part of our attempt to engage citizens in improving air quality by designing the interactive section of a partly developed mobile App.   As requests from citizens to concretly act to improve air quality in Bologna increased, in May 2018 the Bologna Municipality promoted the Air Lab. The participatory process, coordinated by the Foundation for Urban Innovation, aims to enhance the engagement of citizens in improving air quality by a clear change of habits and daily actions. The Lab, open to every citizen, stakeholder, expert or technician, gives the participants a chance to ask questions and necessities, criticalities and best practices to be followed to make Bologna a healthier city. The main goal of the process, shared with the participants, was to create a public communication campaign to improve both the knowledge and the effort of citizens in cleaning the air in the urban context. One of the outputs of Bologna's Air Lab is a mobile App that is currently it its development phase, which needs to be implemented in its interactive section. Be part of our attempt to engage citizens in improving air quality by designing the interactive section of our partly developed mobile App. Useful links to prepare to the Climathon: Datas on Air Quality in Bologna (2017) provided by Arpae: https://www.arpae.it/dettaglio_notizia.asp?id=9224&idlivello=1504   Technical reports provided by Arpae:   https://www.arpae.it/report_ambientali.asp?tipo_elenco=rep_ambientale&idmateria=4&idlivello=1693   https://www.arpae.it/dettaglio_generale.asp?id=3057&idlivello=1692 Reports produced within the AirLab:   http://www.fondazioneinnovazioneurbana.it/45-uncategorised/1811-laboratorio-aria-prossimo-incontro-1-ottobre   Datas on bottom-up monitoring actions:    https://ariapesa.org/  ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/catching-app-the-challenge-improving-urban-air-quality-in-bologna-by-increasing-knowledge-and-citizens-interaction-2
brasov01;Brașov;Challenges in Brasov;Can you help us find solutions to the Brasov challenges for a better and safer future?;air-pollution;Climathon will be held in Brașov this year for the second time, organized by Transilvania University on October 26th, at its R&D Institute. The Climathon participants will develop solutions for the problems that the city of Brașov is facing in the field of climate change within 24 hours.  Romania confronts lately with various extreme weather phenomena, which were not previously reported before, like tornadoes. Brasov City also experienced in the last years some unusual meteo conditions. The challenge for the Climathon 2018 in Brasov is to address the following questions: How to define extreme weather phenomena? What is the perception of such phenomena for the citizens? What is currently being measured and how by the important actors in Brasov City and County: university, research institutes, administration, national agencies and private companies. We invite all our collaborators from the afore-mentioned institutions to participate to Climathon 2018, share the information with the participants and contribute to the formulation of specific problems to be addressed, as well as to the designed solutions. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/innovative-ideas-and-strategies-for-a-better-and-safer-future

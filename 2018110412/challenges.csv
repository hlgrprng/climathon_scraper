adelaide01;Adelaide;challenge;Circular Economy;How can we unlock the benefits of a circular economy in Adelaide?;circular-economy;Capturing the value of a circular economy approach in Adelaide will require keeping products, components and materials at their maximum utility and value. Do you have an idea that could be key to unlocking the benefits of a circular economy in Adelaide? Capturing the value of a circular economy approach in Adelaide will require keeping products, components and materials at their maximum utility and value. This means: designing ‘smart’ products that last longer and can be reused many times sharing things more and making repair the norm recycling materials effectively and converting some waste materials into biofuels displacing fossil fuels and derived products with bio-based materials This approach opens the door for entrepreneurs and innovators to transform the way we manage resources and think about waste. Consider the opportunities in reverse logistics, and in services and digital technologies that can help create a circular economy. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/circular-economy/adelaide-challenge;
alice-springs01;Alice Springs;challenge;Renewable energy;How to utilise the unique characteristics of Alice Springs to incorporate more renewable energy?;energy;" Situated in a hot, arid environment Alice Springs is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. How can we identify opportunities for Alice Springs to reduce its energy consumption through innovative strategies and reduce our overall energy consumption? Alice Springs has a number of unique characteristics, which together, affect the town’s ability to incorporate more renewable energy and reduce consumption: Climate – it is hot in Alice Springs and air-conditioning requires significant energy. Demand peaks – there are two distinct times of the day – morning and evening – where demand is greatly increased. Transient population – according to the NT Planning Commission Alice Springs ‘a transient population has been a general long term trend for Alice Springs’. Isolation and a lack of scale – Alice Springs is a remote town with a small population situated in the centre of Australia. The economies of scale available in large Australian cities are not present in Alice Springs. Low daytime load demand – Alice Springs has recently experienced a new low daytime demand of 8MW. It is forecast that as early as 2023, the Alice Springs daytime load could reach 0MW. This has significant implications for grid stability and security. High level of community support – Alice Springs has a long history of iconic projects and renewable energy initiatives, including through the Alice Solar City program led by Alice Springs Town Council. Alice Springs’ annual renewable energy contribution is currently around 8%, which is higher than the Northern Territory average of 4%. What business or system-wide approaches can we implement to make it easier to reduce our costly reliance on traditional energy generation for Alice Springs as a whole? Potential areas that a Climathon project could tackle are: The split incentives for tenant/landlord solar systems, noting Alice Springs’ high number of residential renters and transient population; Strategies for shifting demand away from early morning/evening, reducing system peaks; Strategies for reducing low daytime demand periods.

ancona01;Ancona;challenge;Better air to breathe;How can we help Ancona improve air quality?;air-pollution;Air pollution in Ancona requires innovative solutions for the reduction of contaminants and harmful emissions according to complexity of a Port City considering traffic towards the city, mobility in and out as well as the production of industrial activities. Air pollution is one of the main environmental and health threats of this era. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) assessment of the burden of disease due to air pollution, more than 2 million premature deaths each year can be attributed to the effects of urban outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution (caused by the burning of solid fuels). WHO believes that reducing levels of one particular type of pollutant (known as PM10) could reduce deaths in polluted cities by as much as 15% every year. The Municipality of Ancona is part of the Italian Network of Healthy Cities promoted by the World Health Organization since 1996, with the adhesion to the aforementioned Network the Municipality of Ancona has decided to reaffirm its role and its commitment to the promotion and protection of health by adopting an inter-sectoral and inter-institutional policy capable of responding to the complexity of the needs that require a high degree of collaboration and integration between the different organizational levels at the local level. The proposed challenge requires 2 inter-connected and related sub-tasks: 1. Sustainable Urban Mobility in response to air pollution. Making urban mobility more sustainable means to reduce city gas emissions. Indeed being Ancona active in industrial, touristic and commercial assests and hosting the administrative offices of Marche region, the university facilities and the Regional Health Headquarters, the urban mobility of Ancona city is one the main problem for air quality. 2.  Developing integrated solutions for the City Port Ancona is hosting the regional industrial port. A project solution that involves the passenger seaport and freight/cargo area and the industrial area will help Ancona to organize its activities. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/air-emissions-reduction-in-the-adriatic-port-city-of-ancona;

A system of Clean Air Towers machines through the city The aim of the project is to realize an integrated system of Clean Air Towers, by placing them in the most polluted areas of the city of Ancona, and to reduce the pollution of the air caused by anthropic activities. The level of air pollution in urban areas is increasing day by day: this happens due to cars and transportation movement, and to the daily commercial activities of the port of Ancona. The evidences that people are suffering more and more several health diseases caused by air pollutants are many: 9 people out 10 are exposed to higher levels of pollution that could tend to illnesses (OMS, 2018) and pollution causes every year 487000 premature deaths, of which 90000 in Italy (Proietti, 2018). Our aim is to reduce the impact of pollutants PM 10, PM 2.5, PM 1, and to contraste the phenomenon of global warming and the side-effect of Chloro Floro Carbons (CFC) on climate changing. By using a wind turbine and solar panels the machine will capture enough energy and will use it to rotate the inhaling suction fan blades into the collecting chamber. This allows the machine to receive pollutants from air in different ways. The first stage of the mechanism consists in filtering in a biological way the air suppurated in different chambers; the second stage is the operation of the machine which exploits the Bernoulli principle; it also helps to avoid to have a negative influence on the bird migration. We also make use of three layers filters to trap particulates such as PM 10 and PM 2.5 and with specific processes we use it to create materials such as asphalt.

Bus collecting and treating particulate matter Providing Ancona's trolleybuses of a particulate matters filter that clear the air during its trip, also allowing to analyse and monitor the collected pollutants. Ancona is affected by high levels of air pollution due to vehicular emissions. We propose the installation of an electrostatic precipitator filter on the roof of Ancona's trolleybuses for the removal of partucilate matter. This filter is able to clean the air that passes through it during the bus's route, collecting particles with dimensions as small as 1µm. Moreover this device allows to monitor the quality of the air and see if there are improvements in time. To apply a screen that shows the results of the amount of particles removed can sensibilize the population to this problem and incourage them to use it as a means of transport. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/respirabus;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/air-pollution/air-emissions-reduction-in-the-adriatic-port-city-of-ancona

An hybride ship would be powered by a solar panel in the portual area so that it wouldn't pollute when close to the city; pollutants emitted nearby the city represent on of the main source of pollution so this represent the first solution to the first problem. The hybrid ship would switch to methane powering source as soon as it leaves from the port. The methane would be produced from a conversion process that take CO2 emitted from industries. In this way we would solve fossil fuel combustion while converting CO2 into methane in a sustainable, scalable solution.

ancona05;Ancona;solution;Cyclodextrins BTEX filters;Cyclodextrins BTEX filters;air-pollution;Development of tools for the filtration of gas emission of automotive, based on functionalized B-cyclodextrin for the removal of nanometric particles (BTEX). Cyclodextrins BTEX filters Development of tools for the filtration of gas emission of automotive, based on functionalized B-cyclodextrin for the removal of nanometric particles (BTEX). The main source of urbans pollution is determined by automotive’s gas exhausted because of the presence of BTEX (benzene, toluene, etilbenzene and xilen) and particulates. This kind of pollutants are toxic not only for the environment, but also for the human health (specially BTEX because of their nanosize). At the moment the real problem is that even if an automotive can respect new requirement of Euro (i.e. Euro 6 standards= 170 mg/km for total hydrocarbons HC+CO), the concentration of BTEX emitted is superior than the admitted value (especially if there are old transports that do not respect these new limits). Fabrication of filter to insert inside the muffler of automotive can be a solution that aspires to reduce the nano pollutants emitted by automotive exhausted gas Cyclodextrins (Cyds) are a type of molecule with a structure similar to a cone, to permits the bond with another molecule on the model of key-locks. This term describes a high specific bond between two similar molecules. The structure of Cyds makes the molecule a kind of pocket that can be selective and specific functionalized thanks to the presence of internal hydroxilic group, so for instance with a methylation it is possible to create an hydrophobic environment to bond molecules as BTEX. One of the main advantages of Cyds is that they can be easily synthetized from starch. Starch can be recovered from food waste, such as potatoes peel. So, this kind of material is a very low cost and widely available one. Moreover it could give a new value to a waste product. For the production of the filter, Electrospinning could be an attractive technology, also because it is a low cost solution. Since it is possible thanks to the electrospinning technique, to obtain a filter composed of nanofibers, these can be easily disposed as fillers for reinforced mortars. In this way, the impact of BTEX on human health is removed because it has been inerted. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/cyclodextrins-btex-filters;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/air-pollution/air-emissions-reduction-in-the-adriatic-port-city-of-ancona

Improve your movement to reduce air pollution Our app is aimed at improving the movement within the city through benefits, for those using public transport. The city of Ancona suffers from important air pollution problems caused by the presence of the port that generates important congestion and traffic problems. This criticality is worsened by the features of local mobility, which is mostly private car oriented (at least 25,000 commuters reach the city every day, 70% of them using cars) decided to focus on local mobility since this the criticality which can be most easily affected by local public and private agents EYM aims to improve the mobility of students across city. Improving the bus, providing them with wi-fi; where the students' smartphones will be connected, recording the routes covered and the kilometres made, and providing a fixed rate of earnings based on the number of kilometres covered. In this way we want to reduce the number of students who do not buy tickets; increase the number of students who choose the bus compared to the car; limit the printing of paper tickets, thus helping to keep the city cleaner. In our idea there are also profits for those who come by train, in relation to the distance from their homes. We also propose the inclusion of totems that will inform people in real time about the quality of the air they are breathing and the benefits or problems that it entails.

athens01;Athens;challenge;Creating Athens’ first open-data Urban Tree Inventory;How can we create Athens’ first open-data Urban Tree Inventory?;extreme-weather;How can Sustainable Design Principles, Technological Breakthroughs & Innovative Civic Engagement be combined to create Athens’ first open-data Urban Tree Inventory? A major challenge for cities in the future will be to meet our need for nature based solutions towards a more resilient city that will be able to withstand climate change and environmental challenges. Athens, a city that suffers from heatwaves, flash floods and poor air quality, has historically wasted, misused and mismanaged its natural resources. It needs a culture change to understand, support, and promote its green infrastructure. The city needs to create, as well as, better manage its green areas. Creating a Tree Inventory is an integral part of Athens Resilience Strategy to integrate natural systems into the urban fabric. An urban tree inventory is the database of accurate information on the health and diversity of an urban green stock. How concerned & active citizens of Athens, together with expert arborists & foresters, research students & members of the Academia, IT specialists & software programmers, innovative entrepreneurs & local businesses, design thinking facilitators & community-based organizations, along with city officials, can create an open data Urban Tree Inventory that will provide information for the planning, design, planting, maintenance, removal of community trees as well as civic usage of green spaces? Good tree inventory practice involves integrating sustainable design principles, available advanced technologies such as the use of AI applications, excellent knowledge of urban forestry & civic land use, and innovative community engagement that encompasses collaboration and co-creation between city officials and citizens. Solutions that Climathon Athens 2018 could focus on:• Developing a holistic approach to spatial planning for open green spaces and greener pedestrian streets in the Municipality of Athens. • Enabling mapping and identification of trees in predefined areas to support public awareness and demonstration activities such as labelling, development, maintenance, etc.• Assessing the benefits of trees and open green areas using environmental and socioeconomic indicators (assessing the flooding reduction potential, ecosystem benefits, social benefits, cognitive function of green spaces, shading and cooling, urban heat island effect, landscape enhancement, etc.).• Adapting or creating business models that will support public-private sector collaborations.• Using design and technology to add value and extend the useful life of current public green spaces.• Establishing co-creation opportunities between city officials, citizens, local businesses, research centers & universities.• Enhance and promote public awareness on trees value and importance in the city with any possible ways (e.g. use of technology, stakeholder engagement processes, others). The aim of the Challenge this year is to fuel new thinking, that will ideally include the holistic analysis of satellite, environmental, biological and socio-economic data and the interactions between open green spaces, water attenuation and spatial planning. Copernicus, EMODnet, BlueBRIDGE, FAO, Eurostat, Natura2000 are among the relevant datasets that will be made available to all participants. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/extreme-weather/creating-athens-first-open-data-urban-tree-inventory;
athens02;Athens;solution;Tree identity, A Co-created Tree Registry;Sustainability, Resilience, Circular, Active Citizenship;extreme-weather;"Trees are a great way to engage citizens in environmental efforts, such as greenhouse gases emissions. It seems that there is no detailed mapping of the tree population in the City. Sustainability, Resilience, Circular, Active Citizenship Trees are a great way to engage citizens in environmental efforts, such as greenhouse gases emissions. It seems that there is no detailed mapping of the tree population in the City. Every city in the world is a living organism that constantly transforms as it updates its functions. Many factors affect the tasks and responsibilities of a city in a broad range of sectors. In order for a city to be able to best serve its people, there is a need to constantly monitor its performance, ideally on a real-time basis. Many cities around the world have already developed mechanisms and tools that measure their performance using state of-the-art digital technologies. Tools such as digital and dynamic maps (GIS maps), dynamic databases on monitoring indicators, sensors and technologies (Internet of Things - IoT) are available for use by any city around the world. The City of Athens is currently using obsolete technologies to measure its performance. This becomes more difficult due to insufficient human resources. On the other hand, Citizens are also unaware of what is happening in the city, while the city decision makers lack the proper tools for effective policy making. The main objective here is to introduce up to date digital technologies to help better manage the City of Athens. City officials will thus be able to draft new policies using real-time data, while demonstrating to the public, for the first time, the dynamic status and performance of the city. The latter will be achieved through a series of actions that will promote its creativity, participatory culture and transparency. The City of Athens currently owns over 120,000 trees which are growing within the city boundaries. There is however no existing registry for these trees. The City will need to ""invent"" how they will build a tree registry, ways to collect tree characteristics and reliable data, about position, type, occupancy, age, classification, and canopy.City services have already started to record the trees on a GIS map but there is a need to build adequate capacity to implement this work. Run a city-wide project, incorporating co-design and co-creation methodologies, for learning, awareness and with practical use. System: Design a system, which balances the complexity of different stakeholder needs and desires. Space: Mix physical public space to an augmented reality environment, which (a.) will give people signals about how to behave and (b.) influence how they feel. Service: Incorporate human centered approaches, in order to design and deliver effective service(s), linked to a vibrant civil society needs and desires, while considering its priorities, limitations and motivation. Product: Deliver a well designed “working” prototype, with clear intention to evolve, while considering the scarcity of the available resources and using innovative thinking.

Our more disadvantaged citizens need to have a say about tackling climate change in the context of their, often difficult, circumstances. To tackle climate change we need to ensure that everyone, from an 8 year old to an 80 year old has their say about how to create sustainable happy communities. Our more disadvantaged citizens need to have a say about tackling climate change in the context of their, often difficult, circumstances. If we don’t, most plans will fail. Birmingham is a city of 1.1 million people in the city with 408,000 Birmingham citizens in the top 10% most deprived in England. Measures to reduce air pollution, such as clean air zones, have been found to impact those from the most deprived communities hardest, leading to increased financial pressures and reduced mobility. In addition, Birmingham has one of the worst recycling rates in the country, creating more pressures on our environment. Evidence tells us that living happy, fulfilling lives is about far more than money or economic growth. We know that citizens who are connected with and contribute to their communities and adopt sustainable behaviours like collaborating and sharing are happier. They start to demand and take decisions for themselves that support this. Communities that behave in this way also therefore take decisions that reduce climate change. We know that increased wellbeing can have positive impacts on air quality and climate change and that large health inequalities are directly linked to poverty in the city. But sadly, we face some massive challenges to make the connection between wellbeing and the environment - such as the role of the car contributing in part to ¼ of Birmingham children being overweight/obese when they start school (rising to 40% by the time they leave primary school) with over 80% of the population are inactive in the city… There is much to be done together if we are to make a change. By creating solutions that educate, involve and engage our poorest communities, we have the best chance of creating a city-wide focus on positive impacts for these citizens rather than making them victims of change. We’ve got 3 we want help with! 1 - How can we give Birmingham citizens a chance for longer, happier lives? What language and actions can we use as citizens to encourage and spread an understanding that real wellbeing comes from caring about your environment, whether that is at a community level or the air you breathe? 2 - How can we make encourage our citizens to feel passionate about the environment they live and work in? Specifically, how can we change Birmingham’s streets and public places to be cleaner, easier to use, enjoy and look at? How can we give our communities a voice to demand or lead positive change about the place they live in, in a practical, environmentally sensitive way? 3 - Lastly, how can we make our city a more healthy, clean and fun place to travel around on a daily basis? What bothers citizens about waste and dirt? What do they think they can do that that can help tackle climate change with regards energy and fuel consumption, waste and recycling, and what is really achievable in the context of their lives?

Brasov City also experienced in the last years some unusual meteo conditions. The challenge for the Climathon 2018 in Brasov is to address the following questions: How to define extreme weather phenomena? What is the perception of such phenomena for the citizens? What is currently being measured and how by the important actors in Brasov City and County: university, research institutes, administration, national agencies and private companies. We invite all our collaborators from the afore-mentioned institutions to participate to Climathon 2018, share the information with the participants and contribute to the formulation of specific problems to be addressed, as well as to the designed solutions. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/innovative-ideas-and-strategies-for-a-better-and-safer-future;
brasov02;Brașov;solution;Better home insulation;Improve thermal resistance of current double glazed window system;extreme-weather;Provide a solution for short term return of investment, for normal citizens, to upgrade their home insulation. They will consume less energy thus produce less waste Improve thermal resistance of current double glazed window system Provide a solution for short term return of investment, for normal citizens, to upgrade their home insulation. They will consume less energy thus produce less waste Better home insulations to produce less waste heat About 40% of heating bill is caused by underperforming window systems. Average heating bill can be about 100 RON a month. With estimated 200k citizens, our city might have about 40k homes ( estimating here, could not find exact info ), with 6 cold months, these families spend about 40% * 100 RON * 6 = 240 RON a year only because of poor window insulation ( only factoring cold weather ). On city scale, it could be as high as 240 * 40k = 9.6 M RON = 2 M Euro spent only on cold period of the year. Better windows already exist, with factors up to 400% improvement. That means after return of investment, up to 1.5M euros could be saved anually. From economy perspective : using better windows could save Brasov city about 1.5M euros per year Most homes use gass heating. These burn fuel which produces CO2. Burnt fuel reduces air quality and contributes to global warming. With the very roughly estimated 2M Euro + the price of from Enel is minimum RON 135.89 MW/h, about 9.6M/135.89 = 70000 MW/h = 70 GW/h is burnt. According to this site ( https://www.wingas.com/fileadmin/Wingas/WINGAS-Studien/Energieversorgung_und_Energiewende_en.pdf ) , about 0.572 kg of CO2 per kWh is generated. 70 GW/h * 572 Ton / GW/ h = 40000 Ton of CO2 released per 6 months of cold waether From pollution perspective, better windows could save about 30000 Ton of CO2 General info : Old window systems can have from 1.7 W / m2 K to 1.2 W / m2 K. Good tripple glazed systems can go down to 0.6 W / M2 K, ROI of 1-2 years. My investigated and proposed solution : 0.3 W/m2 K with reusability of old window and time of ROI of 2 years.

brisbane01;Brisbane;challenge;Too Good to Waste: Helping Brisbane resident's reduce their waste;How can we empower Brisbane residents to tackle climate change by reducing the waste they generate?;waste-management;"Teams are encouraged to develop business ideas, concepts and creations that provide Brisbane resident's with solutions to manage their waste using the top two tiers in the waste hierarchy; Avoid, Reduce and Reuse. Australia is the world’s second largest producer of waste with the average person producing 2.1kg of waste per day with Queenslanders unfortunately exceeding this figure with the average Queenslander producing 2.3kg of waste each day. Yes these figures are shocking but exactly what do they mean for our environment? The climate impact from the waste industry comes primarily from methane generated from the breakdown of waste in landfills. And although you may not be familiar with this greenhouse gas you should know that methane is 84 times more potent than CO2 over a twenty year period which means that every tonne of methane traps as much heat in our atmosphere as 84 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gas emissions are also associated with the production and distribution of the items that we end up throwing away. So reducing waste and using resources more efficiently can also reduce these ‘upstream’ emissions. So, we now know that Queenslanders produce tonnes of waste and this waste has serious consequences for our climate. What now? Well the good news is that where there are large volumes of waste there are economies of scale, and scale is essential in creating a circular economy. A circular economy is an economic performance based model that relies on system wide innovation to create social, environmental and economic capital In a circular economy resources are kept at their highest value at all times and this economic model provides an alternative to the linear ‘take, make, use, dispose’ model that our society currently operates within. On another postive note, there is a growing demand from Brisbane residents seeking ways to reduce their personal waste. Businesses that have targeted this niche have found great sucsess in our city. So the time is right for novel solutions to thrive. Looking at household waste, there are a variety of areas to explore. Waste streams to divert from landfill can include, but are not limited to: Green waste Organic waste Co-mingled recycling Paper and cardboard E-waste (electronic and electrical) Hard rubbish Textile waste The waste cycle begins with generation, then collection and finally disposal. While many people traditionally focus on disposal there are also opportunities to avoid waste by focussing further up the waste cycle. Participants can explore whether they can find business opportunities in avoiding the generation of waste through reuse or by reducing purchases in the first place. How can we empower Brisbane households to tackle climate change by reducing the waste they generate? This is the hot topic that will form the challenge for the 2018 Brisbane Climathon. Teams are encouraged to develop business ideas, concepts and creations that provide Brisbane residents with solutions to manage their waste using the top two tiers in the waste hierarchy; Avoid, Reduce and Reuse. Business ideas generated in response to this challenge should consider the challenges and opportunities unique to Brisbane and seek to reduce waste to landfill and maximise the associated climate benefits.

brno01;Brno;challenge;Evaluation of the meteorological data of Brno;Evaluation of the meteorological data of Brno;air-pollution;Evaluation of the meteorological data of Brno to identify climate hot spots Evaluation of mainly meteorological indicators The challenge contains two parts. The primary challenge should be an evaluation of mainly meteorological indicators, taking into account the changing climatic conditions on Earth. The city of Brno will provide data from meteorological stations that are managed by the ČHMÚ or the city itself. The measured values include NO2, NO4, SO4, CO2, Ozone, PM2,5, PM10, dust and meteorological indicators: wind velocity, max. wind speed, wind direction, maximum wind direction, temperature, pressure, humidity. The challenge is to analyze the data and find the deviations. In a second part, the challenge will be to assess the development of emissions during the period under review (data coverage for almost 20 years). The assessment can disclose anomalies that have occurred and when comparing the time series, it is possible to develop a predictive model for the territory of the City of Brno. The monitored indicators may be comparable to developments at a higher territorial level, e.g. with state or regional values. In order to strengthen its climate resilience, Brno first needs to identify its climate hot spots, where citizens, crucial infrastructure and other assets are at risk. Based on the crucial data evaluation and prediction model, Brno can start building apt mitigation and adaptation strategies. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/the-analysis-of-the-meteorological-station-in-brno;

Challenge by DOMEQ and Foreigners.cz Sustainable or green buildings in Brno. Challenge by DOMEQ and Foreigners.cz Sustainable or green buildings are an outcome of a design philosophy which focuses on increasing the efficiency of resource use — energy, water, and materials — while reducing buildings’ impacts on human health and the environment during the building's lifecycle, through better siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and demolition. Even though green buildings are interpreted in many different ways, a common view is that they should be designed and operated to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by (a) efficiently using energy, water, and other resources, (b) protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity, and (c) reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation. You will be challenged to find out: Which part(s) of the city would be suitable to build green buildings? How would the building be designed or co-design by citizens and with occupants and why? What would be the sustainable features in the operation of the building?

cagliari01;Cagliari;challenge;Sustainable water management, landscapes, cities, citizens.;How much can water contribute to improving the livability and beauty of the places?;waste-management;"Proposal, reflections and suitable solutions for the urban context of Cagliari. According to data provided by the UN, about 1 billion people in the world do not have access to drinking water, more than double, 2.4 billion, suffer from the lack of adequate sanitation and almost 40% of the world population lives with problems of low water availability. In this scenario, the Mediterranean is among the areas of the planet most exposed to the impacts generated by the scarcity of water resources. These critical issues require urgent interventions aimed at favoring the sustainable management of water: it appears necessary to move towards new solutions for saving, towards policies for the development of new forms of sustainable agriculture (about 75% of our available water is today at the service of agriculture), then towards renewed ways of using both public and private Best practices of sustainable management must proceed together with the new sensitivities of citizens towards the public good; in this perspective we consider how much water can contribute to improving the livability and beauty of the places, according to models that have a very long historical and artistic tradition. Water in cities and contemporary landscapes, as a precious element of everyday life, can be the subject of new interpretations and sustainable designs.

cagliari02;Cagliari;challenge;Climate change and urban heat island;How can we face the climate change and urban heat islands?;air-pollution; Towards new urban approach and strategies and action to solve the challenge! The urban heat island (UHI - Urban Heat Island) is a microclimatic phenomenon that involves a significant increase in temperature in certain urban areas, due to the presence of human activities that produce heat (vehicular traffic, air conditioning systems, etc.) and the thermal and radiative characteristics of the materials that make up the built environment (flooring, facades and roofing of buildings, etc.). The same urban form - able to prevent or promote natural ventilation - and the presence of green - with its microclimate regulation properties - are elements that can significantly affect the overheating or mitigation of thermal conditions in cities. Faced with these issues, it is necessary to challenge the current urban planning and urban planning models and approaches, identifying effective strategies for dealing with these phenomena and thus improving the adaptive capacity of cities to the impacts of climate change.The working table will propose a reflection on this theme starting from some areas of the city most subject to the phenomenon, participants will be called to develop strategies and actions, preferring low-cost, scalable and replicable solutions. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/climate-change-and-urban-heat-island-impacts-and-mitigation-measures;
cagliari03;Cagliari;challenge;Sustainable land use: vulnerability and resilience;How can we develop strategies to improve a better land use in the context of Cagliari?;human-behaviour; The value of the soil resource - in terms of the provision of eco-systemic services regulation support and cultural - is one of the causes of its misuse which leads to serious effects deriving from the loss of its functions. The limitation of the consumption of new soils and the definition of development models able to reduce environmental problems, connected with the improper use of the territory, have been central objectives of the European political agenda for several decades now. However, as shown by the data presented in the ISPRA 2018 report, land consumption in Italy does not stop: our country - with 7.7% of the territory sealed by cement and asphalt - is placed in the top European rankings, as one of the countries with the highest land use value in Europe. The lack of awareness of the value of the soil resource - in terms of the provision of eco-systemic services (food products, biomass, etc.), regulation (climate regulation, mitigation of hydrogeological risks, etc.), support (habitat of the species , conservation of biodiversity, etc.) and cultural (landscape, natural heritage, recreational services, etc.) - is one of the causes of its misuse which leads to serious effects deriving from the loss of its functions. Starting from these problems, the working table will develop strategies for reducing land use in the context of Cagliari, proposing solutions aimed at improving the condition of some areas of the city. The participants will also be able to evaluate the possible integration between public intervention and the activities of private subjects, considering this aspect as fundamental for the implementation of the proposed solutions. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/human-behaviour/sustainable-land-use-vulnerability-and-resilience;
cairo01;Cairo;challenge;Tech trends to disrupt waste management industry;How can a tech-enabled solution disrupt solid waste management in Egypt?;air-pollution;"Egypt’s trash is a commodity, just like oil or wheat. New approaches for waste collection and recycling can create green jobs. How can technology with innovative business models be combined to tap into “solid waste management” through the lense of the ""circular economy"". With approximately 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most densely populated country in the Middle East. In 2011, the volume of municipal solid waste amounted to around 22 million tons per year and this figure is forecast to rise by 3.4% each year due to population growth and changing patterns of consumption. The regulatory framework and the expansion of services and infrastructure cannot keep up with these growth rates. It is estimated that only 60% of the waste produced is actually collected, of which less than 20% is recycled or properly disposed of. While public spaces in some municipalities are kept clean, the situation in other parts of the country is precarious. A significant portion of the waste is disposed into canals, rivers, streets or open areas without any treatment or preventive measures. This causes water, soil and air pollution and spoils the landscape. It also poses a serious risk to public and animal health and negatively impacts the economy, especially the tourism sector. A 2002 World Bank study estimated the cost of economic loss from inadequate waste management at between 0.4% and 0.7% of the gross domestic product. Despite international support, the institutions responsible for waste collection and disposal are not yet able to perform their complex tasks. The legal framework is inadequate, and the allocation of responsibilities and tasks remains unclear. The sector is significantly under-financed and there is an enormous need for sustainable investments and services. [GIZ] Cairo’s trash is a commodity, just like oil or wheat, amounting to about 22 million tons annually. Of this amount, potentially 5 million tons can be converted into Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF), and 4 million tons can be turned into organic fertilizer. This is only one example of how there are many opportunities that exist within the field of solid waste management that can be met with innovation and investment. How can a tech-enabled solution disrupt solid waste management in Egypt? CHALLENGE GUIDELINES: Your team may combine technology with innovative business models, rethinking about the opportunity of solid waste management through the lens of the circular economy; Your team can consider how to maximize the efficiency and sustainability of the following four stages when addressing an opportunity in solid waste management: Collection: The process in which different types of waste are disposed and how they are prepared for transfer and transportation. Transportation: Once collected, this process covers how waste reaches the treatment facilities. Separation and Treatment: The process by which waste is separated into different elements. Recycling: The process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. Your team can address a general issue faced within the solid waste management sector, or alternatively, may consider focusing on a particular type of solid waste material, including the following: Agricultural Municipal Industrial (hazardous, non-hazardous) Construction demolition The idea must be feasible and business model viable (applicable to the real world and is a business opportunity that can attract investment). Available city data and local sensitivities should be considered. These solutions may also latch onto or partner with existing corporations, old-guard industry and manufactures. Teams can consult solid waste management experts (coaches/mentors) who will be located on-premise.

How can these challenges be solved in a wetland area taking into account the protection of biodiversity and its sustainability? Castellón is an area with high water stress. The city, and the whole region, have a high dependency on groundwater for urban supply and the forecasts warn about the impact of climate change in the Mediterranean, thus, it is urgent to take measures to mitigate this impact. ""La Marjalería"" is a peri-urban wetland associated with the city aquifer where the phreatic water surfaces. It is a crowded and inhabited area that combines residential zone with agrarian exploitations and green areas with high ecological interest. Formerly, Marjalería remained flooded during the whole year, and it was dedicated for crop rice, but during last 50 years it was drained to avoid diseases and to favor orchards. Currently, a network of pumping wells drains the water, discharging it to ditches and channels that transport it to the sea. In the past, urban policies did not consider climate change effects, contributing to the construction of human settlements with a greater concentration in certain areas. Currently there are around 3068 homes. Climate change is causing long dry periods with sporadic torrential rain episodes. When a rainy season occurs, if the aquifer's water level is high, the drainage network must be forced to avoid flooding. But if the rains are torrential (cold drop), the system is very compromised, and the risk of flooding is very high, even inevitable in most cases. Added to this is the challenge of making the urban settlement and its needs (energy, transport, economic development, etc.) compatible with the preservation of biodiversity and sustainable development in the wetland. In this way we ask the following question: How to create a Smart green-wetland in Marjaleria to adapt Castelló to effects of Climate Change? We will work under a comprehensive perspective, focusing on finding ideas in the following areas: Renewable energy and water management. Urban planning: mobility and construction. Agriculture and food Economic development and tourism Where ideas are treated and developed in each area, such as: Evidence of the effects of climate change: adaptation. Understand the ecosystem: climatology, aquifer, agriculture, urban planning, pollution, ecosystem. How do we define mobility in the area of ​​the marjalería: only access electric cars, only bicycles, pedestrian zones, smoke-free corridors ...? Ecology of the area: fauna, flora ... should we preserve it? What would it be necessary to do? Agriculture / food: responsible / ecological agriculture? What to plant? It is profitable? Is it sustainable? Water reuse, purification, potabilization, use of hydraulic resources in the area. Energy: solar / wind / mini-hydraulic / biomass / batteries / etc ...

copenhagen01;Copenhagen;challenge;Save Bispebjerg from flooding!;How can we implement Copenhagen's Cloudburst Management Plan?;water-management;How to implement an urban green space that reduces flooding in Copenhagen and makes the local citizens feel safer and more engaged in their community? In 2015, Copenhagen adopted a Cloudburst Plan for the entire city in order to reduce the risk of damage from heavy rainfall. The goal is to protect the city from flooding, and, at the same time, will convert the city to a greener and more attractive place to live. “Grønningen”, a park in Copenhagen also known as Bispeparken, is part of the cloudburst plan as a buffer zone that can store surface runoff during intensive rain. The plan is to modify the existing park into a basin that can handle up to 4700 m 3 water in total during a cloudburst as well as manage everyday rainwater from the nearby area. Socioeconomically, the neighborhood surrounding the park is characterized by high unemployment, low levels of education, and low incomes. The area represents a diverse group of people with many nationalities and different age groups. Most of the locals do not always feel safe in the area. Thus, in addition to water management, it is also a goal to boost the area by creating a social meeting place for the locals. Currently, the park is only used by a few people, and the locals do not feel attached to the park. A school is also located at the Southern end of the park and the school children would like to use the park for outdoor activities and learning. Create an urban space at Grønningen that can protect the lower-elevation areas south of the park against flooding by temporarily retaining water Create an attractive green space where locals want to hang out (also in dry weather) How can we use the cloudburst project in Grønningen to help make the citizens feel safer in their daily lives? Today, many citizens experience the northern and southern park areas as two separate parks.

copenhagen02;Copenhagen;solution;Floating Islands to Promote Education and Resilience (FIPER);Floating Islands to Promote Education and Resilience (FIPER);water-management;Bispeparken located on Copenhagen’s high ground is a great place to implement cloudbursts resilience initiatives. Our solution is to develop floating islands inside a reservoir, helping control water levels, acting as a social space and educating the community about the SDGs. Floating Islands to Promote Education and Resilience (FIPER) Bispeparken located on Copenhagen’s high ground is a great place to implement cloudbursts resilience initiatives. Our solution is to develop floating islands inside a reservoir, helping control water levels, acting as a social space and educating the community about the SDGs. Our solution is based on constructing a wet reservoir at Bispeparken with projected capacity to store 2.000 m³ of water that can result from the increase in cloudbursts. The reservoir will have a maximum depth of 1.2 m and cover an area of 20 m times 80 m. The park area is currently not perceived as an alternative to recreation by the community. To provide a total capacity of 3.000 m3 for storm water stores, an underground basin will be constructed at a lower gradient to provide additional 1000 m3 water storage. The wet reservoir and the ground basin will be connected by a two-pipe system. The two pipes will be located respectively at a water capacity of 1000 m3 and 2000 m3. The pipe at 2000 m3 will always be open, providing a flow to the underground storage tank when the water volume extends its capacity, while the pipe at the level of 1000 m3 will only be opened in case of a cloudburst. In this case, the water will be drained from the reservoir to the storage tank. To make the community perceive the area as recreational, 4 floating islands will be developed inside the wet reservoir. One island will be dedicated to a barbeque area, to encourage local use of the park, one will be dedicated in informing the public about the project and the relations to climate change and sustainable development, while the other two will be dedicated on educating SDGs in an interactive and rotating basis. The floating islands will be made from recycled plastic and supported by a system where four poles connected to the ground reaches into four hollow poles. This gives the island the flexibility to adjust its level, while at the same time giving it the stability against horizontal movement. Our solution also proposes specific actions in the most south part of the park, by planting more trees and building a rain garden, which also acts as a buffer for retaining water. We expect that these measures will make the park more attractive to the local community making it cozier. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/floating-islands-to-promote-education-and-resilience-fiper;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/water-management/help-implement-the-copenhagen-cloudburst-management-plan

Svandpe: make the rain a piece of art We address cloudburst problem while combining it with social and design improvements. A water management infrastructure of lakes, channels and “Svandpe” aim to use the water to make the park attractive together with outdoor facilities and to translate the risk of the area in its identity. Svandpe, accompanies other soft and hard elements for water management (storage, retention, infiltration); such as lakes, wetland vegetation, canals (small river), bushes, trees, and an undersurface emergency tank in order to store water, either during a dry or high precipitation period. In addition, Svandpen are connected under the ground with each other and with the emergency tank to control the water level *. We have decided to create three different prototype dimensions for the Svandpe, in order to create a harmony of contrast with the surroundings trees.  Svandpe, also complements outdoors facilities, such as a communitarian garden, running/walking paths, step-bridges over canals, workout stations, benches and playground for the children from the school. Further, Svandpe also complements the mentioned features with a path that goes along the parks, which brings a visual appearance of continuity within the park. With the combination of the presented elements, we show that the actual problem could be turned into actually the identity of the place, that could actually be implemented in other locations with co-benefits such as increase of biodiversity, reduce natural disasters cost and making a stronger community. In order to handle up to 4700 m3 water in total during a cloudburst in Bispeparken, to enhance citizens’ safety sensation, and to create a more continued park, we have decided to implement some elements that cover the three mentioned concerns from a multifunctional manner.From our integrated multifunctional solution, we highlight the introduction of our concept of Svandpe, which is a rain collecting infrastructure with the structure of an inverted mushroom shape made with hard recycled plastic, being transparent in the central core of the element that manages rainwater. inside the center of the structure, there is an empty cylinder which at the base carries a led lamp which light is reflected by a mirror located at the top, equipped with a solar panel used to illuminate the streets in a sustainable and innovative way. The main purpose of the transparent hard plastic and the inside cylinder is to show the citizen’s expressions since the cylinders will be decorated and personalized by the local people, especially from the school, in order to use it as a mechanism to bring closer the people to the park. In addition, a circular seat around the base of the Svandpe is installed, which at the same time has the function of temporal storage of water.In a cloudbust event, rainwater will be collected in the svandpes and will be driven into an undersurface tank located at the south of the park. This means that the svandpes will be interconnected under the ground. Consequently, Svandpes will be located in a pathway along the park, giving a visual continuity of the park.Inside this framework, Svanpe makes the rain a piece of art and bring the water closer to the people, creating an identity in the neighborhood and a less vulnerable and stronger community.

A roof is an ordinary flat in Debrecen is ca. 570 m2. One is the biggest air polluter is the heating system. If you burn the gas, or if you burn the wood, it will pollute the air too. The solar panels can give us the green way of heating. We can use the empty place under and beetween the panels too. It can be a good habitat for succulent plants too, if we bringthere some rocky field too. Not so mutch. The succulant plants don't have any special needs.

delft01;Delft;challenge;Towards an inclusive natural-gas free Delft;What can be our role as citizens in transforming our current natural gas dependent heating systems? ;energy;As part of the Klimaatakkoord municipalities need to establish district heating plans that are disconnected from natural gas, accounting for the social and technical features of each neighborhood. How can citizens take a greater part in making Delft a more climate-friendly city? Despite the fact that natural gas has been considered for decades a better and cleaner alternative energy source than oil and its byproducts, it is know today that there is a wide range of problems associated with its use, mainly its adverse impact on climate change. As the Netherlands have always been pioneers in climate innovation, governments are seeking climate-friendly strategies for the transformation of current urban energy trends. The city of Delft consists of a very diverse building stock which needs to be completely disconnected from natural gas by 2050. Hereby the private homeowners who need to decide on how to disconnect their home from natural gas may prefer tailor-fitted heating solutions, fitting both technical aspects and their personal preferences regarding for instance comfort. In this year's Climathon, the participating teams will work side-by-side with a group of experts and coaches in adressing some of these questions: How can modular/flexible heating concepts, combining various technologies, play a role to provide reliable, comfortable and cost-efficient heating to buildings whereby households can make their own decisions? How can the municipalities cooperate closely with their citizens on finding what the technical and social needs in different districts are? Which technologies can perform best under the specific circumstances of each district? How can the municipality efficiently target its citizens' consumer behaviour in order to guide them through a successful transition into a climate neutral home? Solutions should focus on: Integrating available city data Designing an inclusive approach (involving citizens, DSO's and private parties) Developing a carbon neutral tool that can be provided by a private party, that is modular and flexible Investigating on policy adjustments to incentivise its penetration in the market ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/energy/towards-an-inclusive-natural-gas-free-delft;
delft02;Delft;challenge;Building new climate neutral neighborhoods from scratch: How?;Building Climate-Neutral Neighborhoods: How to make room for innovation, adaptation and cooperation?;waste-management;The process of thinking and designing new neighborhoods from scratch involves careful planning and decision-making, as well as clear ambitions to be matched. How can we sustain an adaptive and sustainable project while working closely with all the stakeholders and preventing lock-in decisions? The city Delft wants to be energy-neutral by 2050. The neighborhood of Schieoevers will be the flagship neighborhood of the municipality of Delft as a new climate neutral neighborhood. By 2030, the current business park will have been transformed into a unique mixed urban area, where people live, work and re-create at the same time. How and at what speed Schieoevers Noord is going to change will depend on the opportunities and initiatives that will arise. To realize this climate neutral neighborhood at a high pace with no-regret decisions and room for innovation, there is a need to ensure that during this process stakeholders (developers, citizens and the municipality) stay focused on the ambitions and cooperate. In order for this to happen, stakeholders need real-time insights on the progress towards achieving the ambitions and insight on the impact of their decisions and behaviour throughout the process. The goal is to bring the environmental interests into the decision-making process early and fully, and make it clear at an early stage which developments are possible in the area. Solutions should focus on: A holistic view on crucial elements of a neighborhood such as: Renewable energy generation (heating and electricity) Mobility Comfort Social Cohesion Circularity of resources - Which aspects of citizen's daily lives should be assessed for the monitoring of the sucess and progress of climate neutral neighborhoods? - How can the benefits of climate neutral development (derived from real data) become visible and attractive for project leaders and/or policy makers? - How can insights into the consequences of decisions be presented to citizens in order to incentivize climate neutral behaviour of citizens? ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/waste-management/thinking-a-new-climate-neutral-neighborhood-from-scratch;

Personalised recommendation system app for natural gas-free homes My Green Print App aid users to make informed decisions on reducing heating requirements and using alternate heating solutions, by providing personalised recommendations based on their individual as well as community profile. Netherlands aims to become entirely free of natural gas by 2050 and this is no easy task as citizens, municipalities and service providers in the network have to collectively make informed decisions to make this transition smoother. Creating awareness among citizens and equipping them with the right solution is crucial in driving this change. According to a European Union survey, around six in ten respondents in Sweden (59%) think that they personally have responsibility for tackling climate change, as do more than half in the Netherlands (55%) and over four in ten in Luxembourg (44%). But the transition from Natural gas is not very easy for them as it involves collaboration between technology, municipality and heat distributors. The solution we propose aims at bringing together all stakeholders using a digital application offering data-informed recommendations. To empower citizens with enough information and incentivise consumption changes, there need to be an inclusive and integrated system. Our proposed recommendation app uses the principle of using data science to develop predictions based on open source datasets such as demographics and minimal personal information to provide tailored sustainable solutions for citizens. The platform recommends the citizens with most suitable green energy solutions based on their profile. Thus, we aim to improve the lack of awareness of alternative energy solutions and their impact on the environment and economy by gamification using Green coins. In our prototype, we mainly focus on sustainable alternative solutions for heating as this is one of the most pressing issues currently. Other than completely phasing out of Natural gas, we also give user recommendations on how to reduce heating energy consumption such as double paned glass for better insulation, smart thermostats, etc. The concept is to have a one-stop solution for sustainable living. We use open source data and historic data regarding phasing out of natural gas in Netherlands to predict the adoption of different heating solutions and reduction in consumption, for example for changing insulation on a regional and community level. We use this as the backend to provide customer specific recommendations/options to people who download the app. We also connect them to suppliers of different technologies as per customer preference. We also provide them the financial and environment benefits of the customer’s choice. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/green-solutions-recommendation-app;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/energy/towards-an-inclusive-natural-gas-free-delft

The Schieoevers neighborhood in Delft has been chosen as the next development site for new potential urban expansion with a mission of being as CO2 neutral as possible. We believe that our proposed product will help to: reuse the existing materials found already on-site design the new construction in a circular way based on the existing materials outsource any leftover building material from across local provinces and potentially all of the Netherlands. The first pilot project is planned to be launched in 2020 with full implementation in 2030. *Source: https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2016-0024.pdf  The solution consists of a scanner which scans the materials of a building and gives an output of the material composition, condition, location and dimension via an app. The scanner will identify the material composition. A deep learning data model will compare the material to existing material databases to identify its condition. The app will be possible to be integrated with Business Information Modelling programs, in order to facilitate the circular design of new constructions.  ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/matscan;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/waste-management/thinking-a-new-climate-neutral-neighborhood-from-scratch

To help increasing the influence of community, the utilization of public area is essential. Thus, Eco-Garden Cafe provides an ecosystem where various aspects of energy and resources are utilized together while at the same creating space to contribute to the collective nature of the citizens. Our Eco-garden cafe is composed with 2 main structures: the cafe and the garden. The cafe is a community-oriented for local residents and TU Delft students to work, study, and hang out Besides the functions of a regular cafe, we also provide extra elements to better connect with our main spirit: bring people together and cultivate their sustainability awareness. Firstly, we promote the “electricity for coffee” idea: There 4 spinners on people can cycle to produce electricit; customers with EVs can discharge their. The electricity contribute to power the cafe can be rewarded as coffee coupons. Secondly, sustainable innovators can use our exhibition space to spread their ideas. Thirdly, CO2 footprint of each item will be shown with the price so customers will have a deeper insight of the actual environment impact of the food and drinks. Lastly, in order to develop frequent customers, a variety of events will be held in the cafe. Our potential partners could be organizations committed to sustainability, such as Climate-KIC & Nissan. To help our customers understand our concept, posters and pictures will be hanged on the wall. The garden has both open-air area and mini greenhouses. The plots are rented to the gardening lovers. In one-combined the cafe and the garden tightly connected as an entire complex. People can sell their grown vegetables and fruit to the cafe; and the coffee residuals can be used to fertilize the mushrooms. The municipality will own this property and pay for all the initial fixed cost, which mostly consists of the building construction and renovation, PV installation, garden equipment, and the furniture. It seems like a lot at the first glance (150,000 euro), but consider that net profit of 7166 euro per month, the pay-back time is short (21 months). The variable cost mainly consists of the expense of staff and the cost of food and drinks. The revenue comes from sale and investment from our potential investors, including PV & EV providers.

dhaka01;Dhaka;challenge;Innovative solution for waste management;How can Dhaka City manage its waste effectively and efficiently with low cost? ;water-management;Dhaka as a mega city produce enormous amount of waste but lacks effective management of waste, contributing to making this city as second least livable among 140 cities. Through this challenge we are looking for innovative business model, products and project plan to manage waste efficiently. According to Global Liveability Ranking 2018, Dhaka city scored 38 out of 100 and ranked 139th out of 140 cities, marking Dhaka as the second least livable city in the world. Environmental pollution has been one of the major catalysts behind. Numerous initiatives have been undertaken to date but unfortunately, none of them have been effective enough to bring efficiency in waste management. According to Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) budget for the fiscal year 2018-2019, approximately Bangladesh Taka (BDT) 2,567.48 crore has been set aside as an allotted budget for waste management and, this figure is BDT 182.65 crore higher than the budget allotted in 2017, with the aim to tackle the persevering problem of waste management more effectively. Dhaka’s solid waste management system has seen no major improvement in the past few years despite various initiatives taken by the two city corporations. After their formation in December 2011, the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) authorities pledged to turn the city into a clean, green, liveable, digital and smart metropolis. In 2016, approximately 6,000 waste bins were installed around Dhaka city for waste disposal but the plan failed as there were no incentives for the citizens to make the best use of it. Consequently, people continued to throw wastes on the streets and some of the bins were even stolen. Designated spots for waste disposal are not used as per law leading to illegal disposals. These illegal disposals create water clogging throughout the city during rainy days. Lack of awareness and poor waste management system continue to be pivotal causes for the ineffectiveness of the 3R method—Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. The inadequate waste treatment plant in the landfills at Aminbazar and Matuail continue to be a threat for arable lands, water resources and aquatic lives besides being unable to tackle the heavy load of waste. The marginalized population, in particular, are at great risk from environmental damage since they lack basic facilities such as proper sanitation and waste management facilities, hygienic drinking water, even though they pay a much higher price for obtaining these facilities. We will try to find innovative and creative ideas to manage waste of Dhaka city efficiently based on Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Our focus will be to explore different business models, new waste management processes and creative policy proposals to address this problem. We will look for a sustainable, attainable and holistic solution for waste management of Dhaka City. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/water-management/solving-the-waste-management-problem-of-dhaka-city;
dhaka02;Dhaka;challenge;Renewable Energy for Everyone;How can we build an energy efficient city where we use renewable energy as main source of power? ;energy;Dhaka City consumes 55% of total generated electricity. Most of the buildings in Dhaka City is deprived of natural ventilation and lighting provisions resulting more energy consumption. City dwellers are not trying to reduce energy consumption. Renewable energy usage is also negligible. Energy is a burning issue for the twenty-first century Bangladesh. With the ever-growing demand for energy to cope with a developing economy on one hand and the impact of climate change on the natural environment on the other, ensuring an adequate supply of energy and its efficient use has become the key factor for sustainable development. Energy efficiency of a residential apartment building can be positively affected by, greater provision of green, water bodies and open space in the surrounding area, linearity of the shape of floor plate, higher ratio of distance to height of adjacent buildings and higher access of natural light into the indoor spaces. Therefore, land-use planning for future residential areas in Dhaka city should conform to proper guidelines of providing these elements. Increased awareness and incentives to use efficient technology is also vital to improved energy efficiency as higher affordability and ignorance can lead to misuse of energy. A dedicated policy, Renewable Energy Policy of Bangladesh, has been in force since 2009, which envisions having 5% power from renewable energy sources by 2015 and 10% by 2020. The government has established Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. To strengthen international cooperation, Bangladesh became one of the initial members of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the only inter-governmental agency working exclusively on renewable energy. Those endeavors manifest Bangladesh's commitment towards the development of renewable energy. As of 2017, Bangladesh has the world’s largest Solar Home System (SHS) program with about 5 million SHS. Over 30 million people are benefitting directly from solar energy and over 100,000 new employment have already been created. Bangladesh is blessed with year-round sunshine (over 300 days per year) and has an enormous potential for solar energy. We have been utilizing solar power wisely and using its experience towards diversifying renewable energy (RE) for maximum use but other sources of renewable energies like wind, water, and solid waste have not been explored that much. Energy efficiency and even its concept is not that much popular among the Citizens. So, we want to explore other sources of renewable energies other than solar to find a sustainable energy solution for this mega city. Unfortunately, sensible use of energy and increasing use of renewable energy in Dhaka City is not going as it should be due to lack of awareness and policy implementation. As the largest consumer of energy in Bangladesh, the energy efficiency of Dhaka City can lead us to achieve sustainable development goals. We are looking for innovative ideas, products, policies, business processes or models and incentive-based models for the city dwellers through which energy consumption in city offices and homes can be reduced or renewable energy usage can be increased throughout the city. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/energy/increasing-the-use-of-renewable-energy-and-decreasing-the-consumption-of-energy;

So here's my Smart Bin can be the solution to this problem. There is no Smart Bin currently using in Bangladesh. My Smart Bin cleverly addresses this problem. The smart bin uses available technology for the betterment of our solid waste disposal system, In spite of having trash bins, people don’t show much interest in dumping their waste in the right place. Here, clever technology with and the unique rewarding system tries to change the mindset of our people and encourage them to use the proper waste disposal. The smart bin has been built in motion sensor in it, which senses if some kind of trash is dropped in it. If the sensor detects that something is dropped in the bin it automatically generates a receipt for the user. Through the use of this receipt, the user can access their reward. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/smart-bin-for-waste-management-2;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/water-management/solving-the-waste-management-problem-of-dhaka-city
dhaka04;Dhaka;solution;Waste into Resources for a sustainable Dhaka City;Presented some ways by which we can turn waste into resources;water-management;The aim of this study was finding out the existing problems of waste management system in Dhaka City and presenting few ways by which we can turn waste into resources. Presented some ways by which we can turn waste into resources The aim of this study was finding out the existing problems of waste management system in Dhaka City and presenting few ways by which we can turn waste into resources. Solutions to Present Waste Management Problems in Dhaka City: To solve the existing problems regarding waste management in Dhaka city, we have to focus on two sectors: Smart dumping and transportation of waste Energy generation from waste Fertilizer generation from waste Smart dumping and Transportation of waste: In existing waste management system, the dustbins are located on street and therefore when wastes are overflowed they fall on the street and thus causes environmental pollution. Besides, the dustbins cover a large area of street and hampers traffic movement resulting in traffic jam. Underground dust containers can be the best solution to these problems.In this system the dustbin is located under the ground in the form of a large bin which has a relatively narrow opening to outside through which the wastes are deployed inside. By this process the waste is kept underground and thus there’s almost no risk of pollution and street clogging. Energy generation from waste: Waste treatment process generating energy in the form of electricity, heat, or transport fuels is considered as waste to energy (WtE) option. Each year 2.3 billion tons of Municipal solid waste (MSW) will be generated by 2025, and this is equivalent to 2.58×1023 MJ of energy. Fertilizer Generation from Waste: Fertilizers are organic or inorganic, natural or synthetic substances that added to soil to enhance plant growth and production.Organic fertilizers can be produced by recycling food waste into useful soil amendment for farming. Organic fertilizers from food waste can reduce the usage of conventional nitrogen based fertilizers that may cause leaching in oceans, rivers and groundwater. Food waste is food material that is unused, discarded and not safe to be consume. Energy conversion from waste can be obtained by utilizing different technologies. Each one of these waste to energy (WtE) solutions has specific characteristics. Factors include the type and composition of waste, its energy content, the desired final energy form, the thermodynamic and chemical conditions in which a WtE plant can operate, and the overall energy efficiency. Incineration: Combustion of MSW is the complete oxidation of the combustible materials contained in the solid waste fuel, and the process is highly exothermic.Initially, the heat in the combustion chamber evaporates the moisture contained in the solid waste and volatilizes the solid waste components.The process leads to the conversion of waste fuel into flue gas, ash and heat. Energy Production:One tonne of municipal solid waste burned in waste-to-energy plants in the United States in 2013 generated about 481 kWh of electricity. Fermentation: Fermentation is a process by which organic waste is converted into an acid or alcohol in the absence of oxygen, leaving a nutrient-rich residue. Fermentation for the production of bio-ethanol, which is of great importance in the transport sector as it is a fuel, is done by yeast strains. Production: Practical bio-ethanol fermentation plants are large, and an optimal sized plant produces about 200,000-300,000 tonnes of ethanol per year. Microbial Fuel Cell: MFCs are biochemical-catalyzed systems in which electricity is produced by oxidizing biodegradable organic matters in the presence of either bacteria or enzyme. Bacteria are more likely to be used in MFCs for electricity production, which also accomplish the biodegradation of organic matters and wastes. Anaerobic digestion: AD is a process by which organic material is broken down by micro-organisms in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas, a methane-rich gas used as a fuel, and digestant, a source of nutrients used as fertilizer. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/waste-into-resources;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/water-management/solving-the-waste-management-problem-of-dhaka-city
dhaka05;Dhaka;solution;Plastic Recycling for Cleaner Future;Recycling of Plastic Wastes to eliminate environmental pollution ;water-management;Collecting plastics through our Magic Bin and recording the number of plastics digitally then converting those into fuel without carbon emissions. Recycling of Plastic Wastes to eliminate environmental pollution Collecting plastics through our Magic Bin and recording the number of plastics digitally then converting those into fuel without carbon emissions. In Dhaka city, Water logging is one of the major problems and the main cause behind that is improper waste management of plastics and polybags. From total waste, around 23% is non-organic waste and plastics makes 8% of that non-biodegradable waste.200000 tonnes of plastics are dumped in the rivers and polybag number is around 14 million each month. So, this huge number of non-organic waste need to be well managed to make our Dhaka city more clean and livable for our city habitats. Our solution has basically two phases. 1. Smart Collection of Plastics 2. An efficient way to convert plastics into fuel. Now, the collection of plastic is a little bit challenging for us as people in our country just throw it away. So, first we need to change the mindset of our people and we are going to do it by introducing a reward system for them. This is going to be done by combining offline and online events. We are going to implement them in five easy steps. 1. Consumers subscribe to our service they will have their profile and record. 2. Save the plastics for us in a magic bin that will be provided them at free of cost. 3. We come to take away their trash and weighing the bins which will be recorded in their digital profile 4. Consumer earns magic points in exchange. 5. These points can be used to avail discounts or gift cards from our collaborative super shops and restaurants (For general shopkeepers they will get some monetary rewards).  Our consumer here are two types, one is individual household and another one is general shopkeepers who will keep our magic bin outside their shop and encourage the buyers to dump those plastics in a magic bin. This will be a win-win situation for both of them as we will record the plastic number for both of them. Shopkeepers will refer the person in our site and refer him that, yes, that particular person dump his plastics in a magic bin. Then we will collect the plastics from the consumers whenever they inform us that their magic bin is full and take it directly to our fuel-making plant. Now, comes our second phase, convert plastics into fuel.70% of plastics can be turned into fuel which can be sold to the cement factory, glass factory, ceramic factory, steel making factory etc. The byproduct carbon black and flammable gas can also be used in other sectors. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/magic-bin-waste-to-fuel;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/water-management/solving-the-waste-management-problem-of-dhaka-city

Hybrid Cooker to reduce gas usage and wastage in urban consumers. The cooker will help you to reduce natural gas use in your cooking and give efficient alternative in gas shortage. Our bad practice of using Bangladesh's natural gas in urban household cooking has cost us badly. We waste a lot of gas due to malpractice and ignorance. Also gas stove is inefficient and creates unnecessary heat and a lot of CO2. Our product will help to reduce the energy loss and emission.  Urban population in Dhaka and other cities in Bangladesh use natural gas as the major fuel in household cooking. But without a metering device the people here took up the bad habit of keeping the stove running to save a single matchstick or to dry the clothes. And gas is depleting, fast. We currently have gas shortage in the country. So, they need to reduce the use of natural gas and move to a better and more efficient source, electricity. But rapid transition is hard, so the households just started to keep both of the options. So we intend to add gas stove and electric cooker to ease the transition and reduce cost and most importantly gas usage. The gas stove will have a control panel and also use the control system of the cooker to have some much needed change. It will use sensor to turn off the cooker if nothing is placed on it for a period of time. It will also be able to turn itself off in a manually selectable time so the user can start cooking and go on doing other jobs and the stove will turn off itself saving fuel and also mitigating the chances of accident. All of it will be available at an affordable price!  ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/efficient-hybrid-cooker;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/energy/increasing-the-use-of-renewable-energy-and-decreasing-the-consumption-of-energy

So it becomes much more dificult to recycle. Categorizing waste into 5 groups- 1. Paper, 2.Glass, 3.Plastic, 4. Metal, 5. Food Waste. To categorize the wastes efficiently the house owner will be given five colored containers by us. Each of that color will symbolize each types of waste. Our waste carrier will collect waste from those bin's and take them to the organization who will buy the waste from us. From food waste, composting is done. Suppose an organization uses this food waste to compost. As plastic, polythene, metal, glass etc. have a good recycling value, these organizations recycle them to reuse. These organizations will pay us for giving them these wastes. The organizations, when trying to generate energy from the solid part of the food waste, a huge amount of carbon dioxide is produced which can be passed through water (Producing Carbonic Acids) & treated with lime to control the pH. Another thing, We will give the users some credits in return for using our system. An app will be developed which will keep track of the earned credits and will convert it into an equivalent monetary value. These credits can be both - 1. Health based, and 2. Utility Based. With us, institutions like hospitals or super shops will be affiliated. All users, organizations and these institutions will have this app. The institutions, if shown the earned credits, will deduct the equivalent amount of money from the overall bill. At the end of the process this used credit will be deducted from the overall earned credit of the users. This app will have access to social media. The users of this app will be appreciated and ranked according to their participation in the process. Higher ranking may also encourage them socially to participate in the process.

Making organic fertilizer from garbage Our management is working on a mobile dustbin (vehicle) which will ambulate throughout the city periodically collecting the wastage and taking to the dumping station outside the city for further processing. Six big cities of Bangladesh generate around 8000 ton garbage daily and the Dhaka city alone is generating about 70% of that total waste. If we consider 50% is organic waste, we can recycle it into compost then it will be beneficial for agriculture as well as it will solve the garbage problem in Dhaka city. This is also needed to reduce the impact on environment like air pollution, odour pollution. As we are working with cheap wastage management so we have focused on a specific part of this problem, which is a mobile dustbin. On this part we are focusing on how we can manage wastage through this van. This mobile van will be unique than the ordinary wastage van which we normally see in our city life. now why this van is unique? Because of its extra facilities such as two chambers which are airtight for reducing the bad smell of the waste. We will collect wastage from the areas by the basis of the capacity of the area. Once we are finished collecting the wastage the mobile van will move outside the city, the landfield of wastage. In that field, there will be a fertilizer industry which will produce fertilizer from organic waste. The inorganic waste we will sell to the plastic industry for further reuse. The organic wastage for fertilizing will be using for total selling part and we will be able to earn money from this. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/mobile-dustbin;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/water-management/solving-the-waste-management-problem-of-dhaka-city
dublin01;Dublin;challenge;Water Management;How can we create innovative solutions to Dublin's water challenges?;water-management;Cities face increasing water challenges due to climate change. Water utilities, such as drinking water infrastructure, wastewater and drainage can be damaged by storms, sea level rise, and unsustainable policies. Climate change also causes water shortage, affecting over 150 million people globally. The World Economic Forum Global Risk Report identified failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation and the water crises – droughts and floods – as the risks with the largest expected global impact over the coming decades (WEF, 2016). Flood events are occurring more frequently causing major damage in urban areas. The frequency and intensity of rain events will increase in the future. Besides flood risk, water shortage is an increasing concern. A recent global study shows that 1 in 4 cities already is water stressed, and climate change and urbanisation will increase the risk for water shortage in peri-urban river basins (McDonald et al., 2014). Water is essential for life. These challenges ask for a systemic approach and a transition in urban planning and urban water management. Water plays an important role for the liveability of cities. We have to rethink the way we deal with water in our cities to create green, resilient and circular cities, so called Water Smart Cities, where collaboration between businesses, public authorities, researchers and citizens plays a unique part to ensure rapid transition. Many cities, including Dublin deal with increasing risks for water shortage, floods and heat waves so the time is now to find solutions. Following presentations by Dublin water authorities, participants will be given 24hrs to find solutions to the challenges they set forward. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/water-management/water-management;

In the long term, this consumer waterprint calculation system is going to push the manufactures to gradually adopt more environment-friendly production procedures. This multi-platform toolkit is designed to link the mainstream local merchandises with clubcard / points collection system. There's existing water footprint database available from global water footprint network. It's possible to add the water footprint information to a particular consumption product. For example, Tesco has its own membership system that records each and every customer's shopping history. Meanwhile, Tesco has its own product database which opens its API to authorised developers. The database includes all information about a product. With the name of the product and the manufacture information, the backend can match the good to the exact or estimated water footprint. At the end of the month, each user can not only see the breakdown of their consumption according to categories, be it fruit, vegies, clothes etc.. They can also see the sum of the water footprint based on their consumption in the existing shops. The app will recommend them alternatives that have lower water footprint. Whenever a user has consciously switched to an option with lower water footprint, a prompt will pop up reinforcing the positive behavior saying 'you've just saved ... litres of fresh water on Earch'. Gradually, users will learn more about what's under the hood of product manufacture and how their purchase decisions will make an impact to the environment. An incentive system can be established in collaboration with businesses and local institutions. For example, institutions can reward students and staff with photo scanning credits, and supermarkets can reward their customers with vouchers as such.An incentive system can be established in collaboration with businesses and local institutions.

edinburgh01;Edinburgh;challenge;How do we capture data on people's experiences?;What do people experience in the city centre? How do we capture and use this data and information?;air-pollution;"There is extensive work seeking to access and use data on how people move in and around the city centre - by foot, bike, car, tram, bus or taxi. But to design a resilient, zero carbon city, we need to understand how people experience public spaces so we can transform Edinburgh's public realm. Edinburgh is one of the fastest growing cities in the UK, expected to have a population of almost 600,000 by 2040. Edinburgh's growth will provide new jobs, homes and amenities, but this growth must be carefully balanced to ensure there remains a high quality of life to residents, access to services and opportunities for all communities. Reducing congestion and vehicle airbourne pollution, improving journey times by public transport, realising the lifelong health benefits of walking and cycling, and creating streets and public spaces that support city living for all are key to sustaining our inspiring capital city. The City is developing three major projects over the next 12 months, on which it is currently consulting its citizens: An action plan for a City Centre Transformation which is vibrant, people-focused and aims to improve the city's community, economic and cultural life; The City Mobility Plan to set citywide transport policy and actions supporting a cleaner, safer, inclusive and accessible transport system, leading to a higher quality of life for Edinburgh residents'; Low Emission Zones - as a step towards protecting Edinburgh's citizens from poor air quality arising from vehicles.  Edinburgh's Climathon challenge is how we access and use data of people's experiences in and around the city.

essen01;Essen;challenge;From the roof to the building/grid - Solar power for all!;Which practicable concepts do we need to implement more solar power systems (photovoltaic) on roofs?;energy;We are looking for practicable concepts in the field of solar power (photovoltaic on roofs) in order to promote the implementation and to distribute the energy (of photovoltaic systems on roofs of schools, homes or work buildings) directly to the buildings or grids. Much solar potential in the Metropole Ruhr! According to a study by the RVR (Regionalverband Ruhr), there are about one million suitable roof areas in the Metropole Ruhr that could be equipped with photovoltaic systems in order to generate sustainable energy for public and private households. The determination of the potential of renewable energies for the Metropole Ruhr has shown that the photovoltaic use on roof surfaces has the highest technical expansion potential. At the same time, the use of photovoltaics on roof surfaces is very low in conflicts compared to other energy sources and the legal and economic framework conditions are good for the majority of users. The region could thus make a significant contribution to the state goal of doubling solar roofs in North Rhine-Westphalia by 2025 (see the main areas of action of the Climate Protection Plan NRW 2015). Private, commercial and municipal roof areas can be taken into account here. In the case of self-using owners of private residential buildings and commercial real estate, neither technical restrictions nor a lack of profitability represent the main obstacles to the realisation of the existing solar roof potential. The economic efficiency is given - the decision makers just do not know it or the realisation is often too complex for them. Good concepts and new ideas are required for the implementation process of solar systems. New business models and forms of cooperation that develop joint ownership of photovoltaic systems. Methods that increase acceptance, knowledge and willingness to invest in solar energy. This is exactly where we want to start with the Climathon 2018 in order to produce great and applicable ideas, so that you can then become reality, so that the city of Essen can achieve its climate goals, decarbonisation! ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/energy/solar-power;
ferrara01;Ferrara;challenge;Chi ha Baura dell’acqua?;Who is afraid of water?;mobility;"The objective of this challenge is to identify innovative ways to move from Baura to Bondeno, using channels and waterways. The city of Ferrara - like many other urban areas in Europe - is experiencing traffic congestion and air pollution. On the other hand, the more peripheral areas of the province undergo a process of depopulation, leading to social disaggregation and paving the way for economic impoverishment, due also to the lack of services - an efficient mobility network first of all - in those areas. That's why the still simple (but great) landscape-symbiosis idea is to make through the existing rich landscape a well inter-connected huge metropolis (from Bondeno on the West to Comacchio on the East with Ferrara in the middle) where people - on demand - could easily and quickly move from a logistic hub to another by boat and bike/bus, thus ""re-using"" what the rich landscape already offers in terms of low-impact mobility infrastructures. The new intermodal mobility solution should therefore positively impact on the whole provincial territory/landscape in multiple ways: in terms of environment/climate (less private cars = less air pollution, less CO2 emissions), at social level (since the peripheral areas will be populated again, improving the quality of living) and last but not least for economic aspects (the re-population of those areas will kick-off diffuse refurbishment/retrofitting measures also at building level and therefore contributing to creating new jobs, while the territory regeneration will also attract new tourists) as well.  Today, even though nearly 30% of Ferrara inhabitants move by bike (the city is also known as ""the bikes city"") and despite great efforts by relevant mobility actors (such as the mobility agency in support of the public transport), private cars are still largely used for reaching the city from the peripheral areas, as this seems today the most effective mobility option. While this happens, with negative impacts either at environmental or social level, Ferrara has a great mobility opportunity - unexplored so far - in its same valuable landscape (most of the concerned areas are UNESCO or Nature2000 heritage) and orography made of existing waterways and canals, dismissed railways lines, cycle lanes, natural walks. The specific objectives of this challenge are: identify social and economic needs of the area considered and highlight governance issues needed for implementing the idea; explore possible business model options, identifying the most relevant stakeholders.

ferrara02;Ferrara;challenge;Hi, do you need a ride to your office?;Car-pooling to work is the solution ... but how in practice?;mobility;"The objective of this challenge is to identify innovative ways to improve solutions for car-pooling, starting from the web application http://carpooling.fe.it/ As part of the POLIS project (funded by the Ministry of the Environment), the Municipality intends to promote car pooling for employees and students of organizations having mobility managers. A web portal created specifically for this purpose could considerably simplify the steps required to publish the trip effectively and to search for available lifts. AMI Ferrara has established an agreement with the Faculty of Engineering, to create a platform for corporate carpooling for local authorities only. This led to the involvement of various experts and to the first realization of a feasibility study and then to the actual implementation of the platform itself. We started by analyzing the real needs of users in the area, to be able to provide a system that meets the needs of potential users and then increase the likelihood that they use it with satisfaction and security. The platform has been online since June 2016 and the system test phase was launched, in which the mobility managers of the participating organizations participated: Ferrara University, AMI Ferrara, AUSL, the Municipality of Ferrara, the Province of Ferrara, Eni-Versalis and Basell (chemical industries in Ferrara), TPER, HERA group and Ospedale di Ferrara. The ""production and maintenance"" phase of the platform was then started, a phase entrusted directly to a spin-off of the Ferrara Faculty of Engineering (FancyPixel SRL). To further improve this platform, we want to implement several features identified in the software following the ideas and suggestions that emerged during various meetings, in which the mobility managers participated. Parallel to the development, management and dissemination of such software to the interested parties, the possibility of free parking for car pool crews in specially reserved spaces, close to the main entrances, in the parking lot of the Cona Hospital which will soon be regulated for a fee.

ferrara03;Ferrara;challenge;How to ... incentivise citizens, workers and visitors;Why should I take a bike instead of using my car?;mobility;"According to a recent survey by the Municipality of Ferrara, almost 50% of citizens use private cars or motorbikes for their home-work trips and for shopping. This percentage is still valid also when considering only residents that live and work inside Ferrara. Our cities are more and more congested by cars that citizens use even in cases where the walking distance is affordable, with severe consequences on pollution, natural resource consumption and effects on global warming. It is estimated by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) that the number of cars in use in 2015 in Europe were 333 million [1], more than the total in the whole of America (NAFTA, Central and South America). i.e. 238 million, also considering a worldwide growth of cars in use from 653 to 947 million in the period 2005 - 2015. As many other cities, Ferrara is searching for innovative solutions to face the problem. In fact, while the city has the merit to be “the city of bicycles”, where almost one third of urban mobility is based on bikes, it still needs to face the problem of vehicular traffic, which causes approximately 29% of CO2 emissions on its territory. [1] http://www.oica.net/category/vehicles-in-use/ Both local authorities and transport companies need to collect data about how and where citizens use bikes or walk, take public transport or use car-pooling, by the use of crowd-sourced data with gamification mechanisms. At the heart of city transportation and smart city mobility planning is the overall reduction of car use – predominantly Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV) trips.This so-called mode-shift from SOV to other forms of more sustainable transportation is essentially a society-level behaviour change intervention. Against this backdrop, car ownership has become engrained in our psyche, and people like their cars and the convenience of using them. So, it is not a simple task to target car owners with mass marketing. Even punitive approaches such as congestion charges (applied in different European cities) have not had a material affect because the city is still congested, and it has pushed the congestion further out beyond the congestion charge zone. Therefore, it requires a closer engagement with individuals to deliver appropriate and contextual information about the impact of using cars, and the viable alternatives available. Modal shift is another way of describing behaviour change. It will continue to be the major underpinning of urban transport initiatives – moving people from SOV to sustainable mobility, including multi-modal journeys and active travel. This will include creating awareness, educating, encouraging a consideration to change, and tracking the changes. It relates to all modes of travel whether it is existing mature modes such as bus and train, or newer modes like car-pooling, car-sharing, and electric bikes. The specific objectives of this challenge are: Identify which kinds of incentives may be applied in Ferrara to increase citizens’ engagement and participation in a ""smart city"" approach. Think beyond awareness raising and education. Look into more engaging co-creation approaches and expertise about subconscious decision making and cultural transformations. Explore possible solutions to promote and enable sustainable mobility behaviours, Analyse examples of existing programmes in other cities (e.g. Bologna, Trento, ...) and find out if similar tools and approaches might be replicated in Ferrara ";https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/mobility/we-need-a-real-behavioural-change-shifting-from-private-cars-to-more-sustainable-mobility-in-the-dailylife;
ferrara04;Ferrara;challenge;CLIMB (Children’s Independent Mobility) for primary schools ;How long, in feet, is the path from home to school?;mobility;"In Ferrara, parents as well as the Municipality ask for the reduction of cars in front of schools; focus is not only on traffic jams during peak-times, but on improving health and safety of children, supporting families in their daily need to pick students to school. As many other cities, Ferrara is searching for innovative mean to face the problem. In fact, while the city has the merit to be “the city of bicycles”, where almost one third of urban mobility is based on bikes, still need to face the problem of vehicular traffic, which causes approximately 29% of CO2 emissions on its territory. In particular, focusing on the use of cars for the home-school mobility, it has to be noted that still 70% of children are taken at school by car. Moreover, in the 50% of cases the school is not on the home-work journey of the parents. The CLIMB Ferrara project (co-funded by Climate KIC) wants to export and adapt the CLIMB solution, already used in Trentino, in the Municipality of Ferrara, scaling it in a different urban context (http://www.smartcommunitylab.it/climb/). This innovative intervention focuses and acts on young generations to address these needs. Education is our best hope and most effective mean to cope with environmental sustainability challenges, since it can empower people with values, knowledge and skills to critically reflect, make informed decisions and act in a sustainable way. Childhood is a privileged time for environmental education: it creates a new attitude of care, respect and sustainable life habits in future generations of citizens and establishes a reinforcement loop spreading the educational impact to their families and the communities they live in.

At the moment, the water distribution system is pretty outdated and faces a leakage issue (estimated costs for leakage respairs per year: 400.000 €). The actual problem is that the people are not aware of the upcoming problems of water scarcity with advancing climate change as well as the possibilities for improving their systems with more intelligent sensor technology. .Our idea is to develop a platform that sensitises, educates and engages all stakeholders involved in the area (farmers, citizens, administration, experts) to implement a smart pipe network. For this, sensors are installed in the pipes which provide real-time data on the water flows and pressures. With this, leakages can be detected and water usage made more efficient. Since this will be a big financial burden, it will not be possible to replace the whole network at once but only step-by-step. Therefore, it is important to keep everyone up to date about the progress and to give them an opportunity to participate actively. Here, the platform comes into place which has different purposes: First, it is used to educate the society about the importance of water as well as responsible water usage, increase awareness of potential problems occuring through water wastage and climate change. Furthermore, it provides information and data about the water distribution system and a FAQ page for the users. It also works as a place to exchange ideas and solutions for the farmers and citizens. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/platform-for-sustainable-water-network;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/water-management/sustainable-water-management-gandesa

AQIS - Air Quality Information System Our information system helps to create awareness of air pollution in the city and gives incentives to reduce it. The pollution data is visualized in a way that every citizen can understand the current pollution and gets in touch with it by displaying it on a website and in public places. Air pollution is a cause of diseases and early deaths by e.g. lung cancer and thus also a cause of GDP loss. But the pollution with really small particles is not visible and thus many people are not aware of it. It can be measured with sensors colleting the particles and giving indication how many particles are in the air at a certain place. Some of these sensors are already installed and measuring around Graz, but their data is not used in public. In Graz, nearly 50 % of travelled ways are done by car - the impact of the traffic on the air pollution can be reduced. Our information system aims at creating awareness of the air pollution in Graz and how it is changing the course over the day and the year. It makes the pollution data easy to understand by displaying it with green or red paths on the city map. It makes sure that the citizens of Graz see that the limit is often exceeded and is installed in different public places like on buses (where also sensors are placed already) or as light on the Island in the Mur. It helps to connect the personal travel behaviour to the air pollution. By adapting the ticket prices of public transport to the current air pollution value, an incentive to travel more climate-friendly is given. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/aqis-air-quality-information-system;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/human-behaviour/micro-climate-made-visible-for-everyone

According to VCÖ calculations, car sharing replaces eight to fifteen private cars. Fewer cars also save parking space. This is particularly relevant in cities, where, for example, more space is available for green spaces or other uses. Furthermore car sharing can already pay off economically under 12,000 kilometres per year. Since there are several cars in 36% of all households and the second cars on average only travel around 8,500 kilometres per year, the potential for car sharing is great. According to Statistik Austria, car sharing is currently only used by 16.5% of Austrians. Game mechanics such as lotteries, rewards such as vouchers and nudges in the form of life wisdoms are intended to motivate drivers and passengers to form a carpool. Immediate positive feedback increases the appeal of carpooling on a regular basis.

grimstad01;Grimstad;challenge;Using Circular Economy to hack Climate Change ;Can we hack Climate Change from a local level? Is Circular Economy a way to RESOLVE climate issues?;circular-economy;Today’s economy is built on a “fast turnover” principle. The faster we replace our gadgets the better. Moving to a circular economy by using and re-using, rather than using up, would yield multiple benefits. In Norwegian cities and regions we are confronting, as in most cities around the world, with major challenges in relation to the amount of waste produced. Some of the waste might be easy to avoid if our lifestyle could change, but there are countless cases where it is very hard to avoid things like: packaging of goods, buying a new appliance instead of repairing the old one, or when looking at industrial scale the management of byproducts and industrial waste. The goal of introducing a Circular Economy system is to eliminate waste and improve resource management and efficiency, which can actually lead to significant economic, social and environmental benefits. How can Grimstad, and the whole of Ager region, together with industry and citizens reduce the amount of waste produced by a linear economy system?  What project ideas could support the transition from a Produce-Use-Discard system to a Resource Management System using creativity, culture, design, alternative approaches and the ReSOLVE framework?Successful circular economy practices involve actions such as integrating sustainable design, production, distribution, consumption and disposal of materials back into the material and resource flows. In most cases they are based on the collaboration and co-creation between producers and consumers. Some examples of circular economy actions that are already yielding positive benefits are: car sharing and car-pooling, object libraries or object banks (renting out objects you only occasionally need, rather than buying them), industrial symbiosis (where a by-product or residual product of one enterprise is used as a resource by another enterprise). Many others exist, and there are many unexplored areas of the circular economy where your idea can make a difference!

helsinki01;Helsinki;challenge;Join the 24h brainstorm for Helsinki sustainable food revolution!;How to create sustainable urban food systems and develop a smart local economy in Tukkutori area?;food;"How to develop the Tukkutori and Teurastamo district, an old wholesale, warehouse and abattoir area located in the heart of Helsinki, to become an urban food hub serving the local neighborhoods and the leader for a sustainable food revolution in the whole city? The City of Helsinki has set a target to become a carbon neutral city by the end of 2035. Carbon Neutral Helsinki 2035 action plan includes details how to reduce energy consumption and how to increase on-site renewable energy generation in the city. Helsinki’s definition of carbon neutrality is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated within the city borders by 80% and to offset the rest. Helsinki seeks to build a functional and carbon-neutral city together with citizens and businesses. The population of Helsinki is estimated to grow from the current 640,000 to 780,000 by 2035. The biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Helsinki is heating. According to the action plan, the city can economically cut the heat energy consumption of buildings with ambitious energy-efficiency upgrades in the old building stock, stricter standards in new construction, heat recovery, and geothermal heating. However in the urban consumption, housing, transport and food are the biggest contributors to the carbon food print of Helsinki. Recent estimates have revealed that the carbon foot print of housing has diminished but the carbon foot print of food products remains the same. Therefore there is a potential to make an impact by creating new innovations for urban food systems including solutions for production, consumption, retail, waste management and energy. Helsinki climate actions can also contribute to the creation of new jobs and sustainable businesses. Tukkutori/Teurastamo district (The City of Helsinki Wholesale Food Market) is an old wholesale and warehouse area located in central Helsinki. The area also used to be a location of a large abattoir but the old butchery now has a new life as a restaurant complex. The district can be divided into two parts; the former abbatoir area Teurastamo where the majority of the buildings have already been renovated and transformed into locations for restaurants, bars, events and pop-up markets. The other part is Tukkutori that is still an area for wholesale and logistics. Also a freezing plant owned by the City of Helsinki occupies one corner of the area. Although in Teurastamo the small scale food factories already operate and the restaurants have been opened, the full potential of the area as urban food hub of Helsinki is still underdeveloped. Helsinki Climathon challenge is to develop the Tukkutori/Teurastamo district to become a sustainable and commercially viable urban food hub. The Helsinki Climathon challenge in 2018 wants to inspire students, researchers, companies and citizens to think fresh ideas for: Sustainable and commercially viable urban farming and food production ecosystems  OR Teurastamo/Tukkutori area becoming a well-functioning local economy in food retail and consumption by engaging the local produces and residents, by arranging last mile logistics and by local marketing ";https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/food/growing-local-creating-tukkutori-sustainable-urban-food-hub;

After Journey The journey of undervalued food after they are off from supermarket shelfs. Food waste contributes a big part to our carbon footprint. In Finland alone, the annual food waste is estimated to be 335 - 460 kilograms, which can be translated to CO2 equivalent of 1000 million kilograms per year. There are recurrent food waste in supermarkets that are continuous but avoidable. Food products that are still in good condition for consumption are usually not sold just because they do not look good or they are close to expiration date. Such pattern of consumer behavior results in huge food waste, which our team believe can be mitigated, improved and better by implementing our system. Our idea is to build at first a B2B platform that connects stakeholders such as supermarkets and raw food material consuming business such as restaurants and food production companies for win-win situations. By providing improved logistics service, we offer supermarkets cheaper price for picking up their food that can not be sold due to their bad looks or the fact that they are close to expiration date. After sorting the food, we will put the food on a platform for potential business partners such as food companies and restaurants to see their availability, and distribute the food products according to the order. The restaurants also get the food at a fraction of the market price. By doing so, we create a win-win situation for all parties involved and reduce our food waste and therefore our carbon footprint. At further stages, the platform involves also the community, comprehended as costumers, turning it as a B2C integrated platform. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/after-journey;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/food/growing-local-creating-tukkutori-sustainable-urban-food-hub

Sustainable greenhouse gardening to attract winter customers Our Winter Garden is a closed loop system of energy and materials to reduce the biowaste and packaging of Tukkutori Food Hub. Tukkutori is a Food Hub in the city of Helsinki that would like to develop in a direction of sustainability. At the same time, the place faces the problems of lacking customer during the winter time. The deeper reason behind lacking customer during the winter is that the Finnish winter is cold and dark, so the attractive point of Tukkutori during the summer, the outdoor events and activities, is not possible to be held. Local gardens and green spots are the meeting points where the community connects with each other and nature during the summer, but these places are not available in the winter due to the cold weather. Therefore, we plan a sustainable greenhouse as a platform for the community to do winter gardening, meet each other, attend events, or just relax with green surrounding. The greenhouse will be built in a sustainable way: Flexible structure: the roof and doors are retractable. During the winter time, the complete structure of greenhouse can retain heat and thus the warm area with garden, sauna, meeting areas will attract people. For summer, the greenhouse roof and doors can be removed for summer outdoor activities and build it back when next winter comes. The space can also be served as a place for wholesale market in the early morning. The system of the greenhouse: Closed loop/sustainable energy system (heating and electricity): Transformed from biowaste from the restaurant, fish company, bakery, distillery Solar panel at the roof of the greenhouse Closed loop of the material: Biowaste can be also transformed to compost and liquid CO2 for greenhouse farming The planted vegetable in the greenhouse can be used for restaurant The box of from fish company can used to grow the plant Environmentally friendly water: snow.

Modular vertical supply Changing the perseption of efficient delivery and deployment for local producers, optimizing the space occupation and navigating the food supply. A delivery step of the supply chain is considered as the most problematic and not sustainable due to not efficient routing and so huge emission amounts released into the atmosphere. So, I want to optimize the process of delivering food to individual suppliers, shops, restaurants, cafes and other enterprises, companies, organizations, universities, schools, and other interested parties who want to be involved in the supply food chain, where food comes directly from the local producers, which fact is also contributing to the climate change and sustainability of the city. Moreover, this solution will be able to deal with insufficient area applications or use. Use the modular blocks to fit the maximum amount of vegetables\fruits, probably milk, dairy products, including other development ways in the future, and short-term preservation or storage at the place of the delivery.  ""Modular vertical supply"" are modules applicable for food transportation and short-term preservation along the supply chain, mainly on the delivery step from local producers to their customers, no matter if those are individual consumers, like families or simply any person or different kinds of enterprises, like shops, restaurants, cafes, schools, other interested parties, companies or organizations, maybe even further manufacturing.

Ideas on how to make sustainable vertical farming more widespread We present a plan of a pilot, the purpose of which is to familiarize consumers and producers with vertical farming. Most of the food today is produced away from the cities where most of the world's population live. This leads to costs and pollution produced by cargo ships, trucks etc. Additionally, the situation leads to cities not being self-subsistent and the population of the cities starting to enstrange from the realities of food production. The plan is to change this situation by making urban food sustainable, easy and fun. This we aim to achieve using the developing vertical farming technologies, such as hydro- and aeroponics. In these systems the nutritents and water are kept on a closed cycle, so a lot less of them is needed, and these valuable ingredients won't go to waste, eutrophication or such. What is more, the energy-efficiency of the farm is enhanced by using LED-lights that only propuce the wavelengths the plants need. All this can be achieved with modern techonology with a realtively low cost. However, the challenge is to implement the technology and biological conciderations. We did some online research on that and found that potential species to use are strawberries, tomatoes and basils. We also would like to encourage the producers to try exotic species that would otherwise be shipped from far away. Investigating what kind of environments the plants live now we can make some educated guesses when it comes to how successfuol they will be in vertical farming. One promising species is physalis peruviana, also known as goldenberry. After the technological implementation of vertical farming, we still need to attract consumers to it. In this the current customer base of Tukkutori would be ideal. So the idea is that anyone coukd come to the farms and pick their own food fresh from the stems. That would hopefully produce postive experiences aroud vertical farming. Ultimately we hope this would lead to widesread adoption of vertical farming technologies, as they would be especially useful in developing countries, where plant diseases and lack of resources are huge problems. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/vertical-farming-pilot;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/food/growing-local-creating-tukkutori-sustainable-urban-food-hub

The secret weapon are the chairs which use sitting human weight as a source of energy and can be used to power light-bulbs Since Climate Change is approaching, we have to think about new way of keeping the temperature from rising below 2 degrees Celsius. However, we also ought to think about adaptation. Since Finland is not really in a good geographical position to use the Solar energy nor wind energy, the energy like gravitational energy could be used to power the small household in any environment since the gravitational force is constant, always present force in the nature.  The area we were working on is Tukkutori, Helsinki. We envisioned the area as a food hub, which would involve several aspects of sustainability, while also having a great impact on local economy and strenghten local communities. The pilot project we propose is to create a small eating area which would become a coffee shop/bar, supplied by local suppliers (distillery, bakery, etc), hence supporting them as well. Also, the area would become a home, for the first time in the world, to special innovative chairs which create energy by using gravitational force. The main idea is to transform the potential energy from the gravitational pull of the chair and convert it into kinetic energy. The person sitting in the chair wouldn't feel the ""descending"" action, since the velocity of the chair would be too slow to notice (30 cm/h). The energy is then transfered to a LEDlightbulb connected to the energy supply system of the chair. Besides somewhat ""non action"" way of creating energy, the customers are able to learn that there are better and alternative ways of producting energy, which would make them feel involved in the energy conservation and would create more awareness. Moreover, by installing this system, the area would get a really good reputation, which would attract a lot of tourists and curious citizens, whcih would in turn have a great impact on the area and local economy. Its estimated that in the future the price of one of these types of chairs would be around 50euros more expensive than a reagular one.

The Tukkutori area already has the space, businesses and services to provide the potential to become a sustainable food hub promoting a change in attitudes toward food production and distribution. It also lacks of any ongoing activities during fall,winter and spring. We want to bring Tukkutori alive by building a community around local food production in the middle of the city with the help of Evergreen Farm. By turning the whole Tukkutori-area into one big collective urban farm, we can locally produce a vast amount of food, create a large testbed for future urban farming innovation and educate each other and the local population in sustainable food culture. By combining the effort of local farmers, restaurants, food markets and citizens, we switch to a circular production and consumption of food products, and turn the Tukkutori area into a whole-year around event center. To realize this we propose a process in three phases: We kickstart the local, circular food production by installing indoor vertical farms in unpurposed spaces. These are followed by other companies constructing green roofs, green walls and community gardens, enhancing the marketing of the area. Next we bring in universities and startup accelerators to support research and innovation in urban food culture of Helsinki. We also arrange more events, workshops and volunteering activities for underserved communities. And last, partly as a result of the research, new businesses will provide services that allow us to close the circle. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/local-circulal-food-production;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/food/growing-local-creating-tukkutori-sustainable-urban-food-hub

Climathon-İzmir18’s Priority Problem Area? Turkey's water needs on a global scale study conducted in 2030 for 30%, 40% increase in energy requirements is expected. Such an increase in demand will cause undesirable negative effects on ecological balances. Since the past, the city of İzmir has been positioned by different civilizations on the basis of eden intercontinental trade. In 1923, in the same way as the first economic program of modern Turkey it was determined to follow in Izmir Economy Congress. Secondly, the Izmir Development Agency prepared the Izmir Regional Plan 2014-2023 document by bringing together the different components of the city such as civil society, academia and business world. As indicated in this plan, the priority areas of the city are built on, Strong Economy, High Quality of Life, Strong Society. In this context, we can read the background that the city expresses itself through multilateral economic relations and plan economic models. When we look at the relationship between climate change and economy, we face a mutual process. In international platforms such as the European Union and the United Nations, discussions on the current form of the process and its future needs, are ongoing and models are suggested. One of the models developed by the developed countries is called Sustainable Economy or Circular Economy. With its renewable energy sources, İzmir has the advantages of transforming the existing production and service delivery model into a sustainable economy model with its qualified work force and universities specialized in different fields. However, this transition is in areas where the process is painful. In summary, these problems; How can we improve waste management? Waste management is a series of processes that involve the design, production, waste disposal, recycling and / or disposal of any product from design to production. In order to extend the use of existing products within the framework of prevention principle in waste management, the stages of repair, maintenance, renewal are also important. It is aimed to recover the wastes that cannot be prevented by means such as recycling and energy recovery. With an innovative perspective in integrated waste management, especially in storage and disposal processes, waste management processes can be improved and positive benefits can be achieved for İzmir economy. How can we apply the circular economy model? In contrast to the traditional ‘linear economy model, the circular economy is a model in which both the consumer and the producer take responsibility for ensuring sustainable production of limited resources. In parallel with the increase in the global population, the model has started to be discussed by decision makers with the correct increase in energy and raw material needs. In this system, there are stages such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy and reducing carbon footprint. There is a need for structural reforms in the economy through an innovative approach to the transition to the circular economy. How can we reduce the carbon footprints of office / administrative administration buildings? Businesses can minimize the impacts of climate change not only in the production process but also in small steps they can take in offices. For example, the separation of waste such as paper, glass, plastic, and the realization of lighting on the basis of energy efficiency are some of the measures to reduce the carbon footprint. Innovative solutions can increase the impact of combating climate change, especially in offices where white-collar workers work intensively.

jalingo01;Jalingo;challenge;Pick The Can;How can entrepreneurs be encouraged in plastic waste businesses in our city?;waste-management;I want to encourage entrepreneurs and youths with innovations that provides adoptable cultures in plastic waste to know how to be engaged in processing plastic waste into commercial products and management to curtail flooding, improve soil texture, clean water and cities. Disposal of plastic waste is on the increase in our city on a daily bases, affecting the environment in so many ways. And there is no physical structure or a system put in place either by government or individuals to management waste in order to address these challenges. Human attitude has contributed significantly to the menace, and over 65% of people will still dump on the street or waterways even if you share collection bags and offer to pick them for free. As a result, waterways are blocked and negative changes occur on our soil, coursing flood, affecting agriculture, health, hygiene, and damage on the environment. 80% of the waste that remained un-decayed is plastic waste, and lays around every corner of the city, making the whole environment unhealthy and inhabitable. I want to encourage entrepreneurs and individuals to come up with entrepreneurial innovations that provides adoptable cultures in plastic waste, either PET or plastic bottles, cans and water sachets processing into products in different forms like, synthetic fibres, cotton, ropes, toys, bags, rubbers, plastic, etc, that are needed in our society for daily consumption and or management to curtail flooding, improve soil texture and clean cities. The products could be main for architectural finishing works like on-lays, trims wall panels, flooring panels, ceiling panels and molds making for concrete and resin castings, decorative appliques, tick sheets for furniture works, etc. One person doing this alone in the city, cannot make or create much impact, compared to the level of waste dump in every corner of the city. The rain is still on the sky and they could still be more heavy rains, yet this year, lots of lives and properties worth millions have been lost due to flooding, most of which is coursed by blockages on waterways reference to media reports of 9th October, 2018 on NTA. What are the potential innovations that individuals, entrepreneurs, organizations and institutions need to explore from the plastic and polythene waste, that is on the increase on a daily bases in our cities, is what Pick the Can is out to address.  Report of flooding across various cities in Nigeria has been on media recently. One of such report was published on the Punch Newspaper of 11th August, 2018 indicating the damages coursed by flood in Kasina state and that of July 13, in Ogun state were 11 persons reportedly died and properties perished in flooding at Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Among the deceased were a food vendor, Halirat Akintobi, and her two sons. About 750 buildings were affected while 6,030 persons were displaced according to the National Emergency Management Agency. The authorities blamed the flooding on indiscriminate dumping of refuse in drainages and canals. These has been happening on a yearly bases. The situation continuously became worst and government over the years has fail to provide a structure like a waste management environment that is adoptable in our cities and communities in the country. A report released by the Lagos State Government in 2017 stated that less than 30 per cent of over 13,000 metric tons of waste generated in the state daily is recycled. A rapid increase in the population and number of plastic-based products has also made waste management taxing. Many beverage companies that hitherto produced with crystal bottles have changed to PET bottles to cut cost. It is common to see people burning waste materials, including plastic, in a desperate attempt to get rid of rubbish from their surroundings. Sadly, most of those who do this unwholesome practice are ignorant of its health implications. Lawani and Amusa are two of a few individuals who have ventured into small scale recycling in Nigeria as evident in the large percentage of unmanaged waste plastic across communities in the country according to Punch Newspaper, indicating that something is still missing along the line. Nigeria has 7 cities with more than a million people, 80 cities with between 100,000 and 1 million people, and 248 cities with between 10,000 and 100,000 people. Pick The Can is going to continue as an initiative to draw entrepreneurs, individuals, organizations and institutions to a knowhow in plastic waste management in a view to breed a force that is ready to tackle waste management challenges professionally. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/waste-management/pick-the-can;

Yet, it is also slowly becoming the waste capital of Africa. Join us in providing innovative solutions that would transform Lagos to a waste free and sustainable city. Lagos with its rapid urbanization and infrastructural development is a victim of its own success. The population of the state is estimated at around 22 million and is still growing as it continues to receive boosts from ceaseless migration from the hinterland and the West African suburbs. As the country’s commercial hub, Lagos houses about 2,000 Industrial complexes, 15,000 commercial ventures and a burgeoning middle class with high purchasing power. Despite its unique commercial and infrastructural status, the waste generated in the State is projected at 1.2 kg per person per day which according to the World Bank far outweighs the official figure of 13,000 tons per day. This figure is projected to rise to 1.42 kg in the next fifteen years hence presents a serious cause for concern. This state of affair is further aggravated by the behavioral stance of the populace who perceive waste management as the sole responsibility of government and or its agencies.

Population growth and increasing urbanisation in Lagos has significantly outnumbered social infrastructure and waste management capabilities. Urban Planning for Sustainable Waste Management Currently, Lagos is the most populous city in Africa, serves as the commercial capital of Nigeria. Population growth and increasing urbanisation in Lagos has significantly outnumbered social infrastructure and waste management capabilities. Waste generation is as old as the world itself, but what makes the difference is the content and how it’s being generated. In recent times, African major cities are faced with population upsurge due to the improvement in lifestyle and influx of people from city fringes. Lagos state is the commercial life wire of the country-Nigeria, with the ever-increasing population of well over 17million (Gazette; No, Vol. 96). Lagos comes second (2nd) in Africa population chart behind Cairo (WES, 2018) and with waste Generation Capacity Per Capital (GCPC) of about 0.5kg/person/day, totalling 900 metric tons of waste daily according to the State of the Environment Report 2010. To manage this effectively is essential for both government and the private sectors. In this part of the world, the issue of Waste Management (WM) is being handled by both Private and Public Sector (PPS), with the government providing Law and Regulatory framework for their operations. The Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) and in recent times, Cleaner Lagos Initiative (CLI) is the central body in the state responsible for waste managing in the Lagos Megacity (LM). Coordination of waste management has been challenging, leading to heaps of waste, all around the state. The continuously expanding population makes it difficult to track the rate at which wastes are being generated and managed in the state. The obligations need to be delegated into smaller units in order for focal points to be established. 1. DECENTRALIZATION OF ACTIVITIES A social structure for street associations should be recognized under LAWMA. A hierarchical order of waste generation, transportation and management should be established. This will be structured in the following order;i. The State Governmentii. The Local Governmentiii. Street Associations ● The State Government is to be in charge of Laws and Regulations (LR) including some aspects of waste management.● The Local Government should be equipped enough to tackle waste of any magnitude and capacity of staff should be built to cater for same.● Street Associations these are communities units with members in charge of monitoring and recording the development within that area. Feedback would be given to the larger body on the details for the type of waste generated from households, the number of occupants in each household. 2. PLANNING BEFORE DEVELOPMENTDevelopment in Lagos State is ahead of its Planning. This is one of the reasons why data collection on waste management has not been so easy. The government has not been able to capture the rate at which waste is being generated in the State. With adequate planning and development control details on waste management, this will be easily remedied. The following is hereby proposed; ● A proposed model plan for areas in the state; an estimate of the population capacity of the project must be stated and response to details of waste management facilities should fit the population needs of the plan.● Spatial information on existing locations in the state must be updated to the master plan in order for new development to be tracked on the systems with the help of GPS and Waste Management APP (WMA).● A Waste Management Master Plan (WMMP) should be created for the state in order to make informed decision to monitor and track information related to waste that is being generated.

Innovative solutions must make it possible to efficiently organize logistics in urban areas. Logistics is essential to any business because it aims to meet the demands of its customers. Today our urban environment faces many challenges which are responsible for the traffic congestion in the city: An increase in the population An increase in the number of sales outlets Major efforts to increase inventory turnover The multiplication of references in stores reducing the storage capacity The development of e-commerce Direct deliveries to private individuals These factors lead to many negative consequences including: pollution, noise, quality of life for city dwellers, etc. Faced with this situation, it is necessary to rethink how items in cities are delivered. Lausanne is looking for solutions and measures to improve the comfort of its residents and the environmental nuisances. Instructions to participants: Participants determine the needs and constraints of urban logistics in Lausanne ; Participants propose solutions allowing a better efficiency of the logistics chain and a reduction of the nuisances ; The behavior change aspect does not have to be addressed. The challenge is focused on infrastructures and technical solutions ; The solutions will include 2 aspects: 1. Purchases made on the internet (e-commerce) that are more and more frequent, and their delivery. 2. Purchases made in urban areas (in shops, etc.) and transported to the homes of the purchasers.

lausanne02;Lausanne;challenge;Shared electric mobility;How to make the transition to electric mobility collaborative and shared ?;mobility;"A transition to electric mobility seems inevitable and desirable. That being said, simply replacing the petrol / diesel engine with an electric motor will not be enough to meet energy and climate challenges. The electric car brings undeniable advantages compared to conventional cars: almost no pollution or CO2 emission when used, less noise at low speeds. There are environmental problems with production in other countries, but the overall ecological balance is largely positive, particularly in the case of Switzerland, because of the predominantly renewable source electricity consumed in that country. Indeed, the source of production of electricity consumed is a key factor at the environmental level. That being said, all the other problems related to the quantity of cars in circulation will not be solved by this substitution of engine in cars (territorial grip, traffic jams, cost of diplacement, road accidents, depletion of natural resources, pollution in producing countries, etc.). Based on the observation that replacing a petrol / diesel engine with an electric motor will not be enough to meet the energy and climate challenges, the challenge is to think of collaborative and shared mobility solutions dedicated to electric mobility. Beyond the bicycle and conventional public transport (not the subject here), the modes of movement and use of vehicles must be redesigned and evolve towards including car sharing and large-scale carpooling. The scope of solutions should concern the inhabitants of the Canton de Vaud, taking into account the specificities of urban areas and peripheral regions. On the other hand, even if electric 2-wheelers are not necessarily excluded from the reflection, the emphasis should be on 4-wheeled vehicles, because it is the current fleet of cars that must be replaced, with a search for seating optimization. This therefore concerns passenger cars, ranging from a cart to a minibus. The proposed solutions can be operated by any type of actors; this may be the responsability of either a public transport operator or a municipal administration, or private people wishing to share their private car with neighbours. We can also imagine intermediate models of the cooperative type of neighborhood association that offer a mobility service, more or less locally, or other ideas... Instructions to participants: Participants will consider the advantages and disadvantages of electric mobility versus traditional individual mobility, as well as synergies with shared modes of use. The solutions proposed by the participants will have to take into consideration and use existing and mature technologies or close to being. For exemple, a driverless shuttle is at the crossroads of what can be envisaged, as pilot projects have in part proved their worth. Proposed solutions must be linked to service offerings allowing pooling and the emergence of solutions. ";https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/mobility/shared-electric-mobility;

The costs of road congestion are multiple. Its impacts are experienced on a daily basis by thousands of motorists trapped in endless traffic jama, and by companies suffering from increased delivery times or emplyee delays. Road congestion also increases greenhouse gaz (GHG) emissions due to the excess fuel consumed in traffic jams, and this also has health implication since car pollution increases the risk of asthma, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stress, etc. The A1 motorway between Lausanne and Geneva is one of the busiest highway in Switzerland and this creates not only economic costs but also frustration among commuters and a high environmental pollution rate. That might also add a loss of productivity and impact the Swiss economy. Projections show today that traffic to the part of the A1 will continue to grow. Today, thanks to the anonymous and aggregated mobility profiles of mobile phones (while respecting and preserving privacy) , it is possible to analyse mobility flows and to find new solutions to motivate commuters to use alternative modes of transportation to reduce the pollution, or even to opt for other solutions, such as home office working. Swisscom, as part of the Climathon 2018, wants to understand how it could be possible to encourage commuters who live between Lausanne and Geneva to use alternative modes of transportation such as public transportation, carpooling, cycling, etc., even to opt for home office working. Two working hypothesis could be verified: Commuters use their cars during rush hours to go to their place of work. They are therefore responsible for the excessive traffic on the motorway. Is the number of vehicles responsible for the congestion? Are there other factors that justify traffic jams? Is it a personal preference to use private vehicles because commuters think that it will be faster this way? To meet this challenge, Swisscom, as part of its Smart City and Corporate Responsability programs, provides population anonymous and aggregated mobility data that can be leveraged. These data allow a representation of a large part of the mobiliy. In addition, Swisscom encourages the use of its open data that can be found on the following website: https://opendata.swisscom.com/pages/home/ The data analysis could notably make it possible to: Notify travelers when the highway is overloaded ; Plan efficiently public transportation or other modes of transportation such as carpooling, bike-sharing, etc. Reduce the impact of mobility on the environment.

For example, the swiss company of car sharing ""mobility"" concentrate its activity in the city centers. By creating a consulting office, we help people to change their way of thinking living in suburban. First of all we analyze the area and the needs of citizen. We then suggest them alternative mobility solutions. For example, if three people take the same trip from the same place, it could be a solution to use shared (electric) car. If the community is interested in this solution, we would start contacting car sharing companies and ask them their service. On the other size, if a neighbor has a car and doesn't use it, we could convince him to share his car and to allow three or four people to use this new way of mobility. Furthermore, to give the easiest way to access to shared electric car, we could design and make an app to help users to plan, check the accessibility and the availability of a car.

lecce01;Lecce;challenge;Impacts of urban green spaces and climate change on cities;Are urban green spaces a solution for a more resilient city?;extreme-weather;Imagine the green spaces as urban infrastructure, able to improve conditions in cities while taking into account some specific phenomena correlated to climate change, such as urban heat islands and extreme precipitation events in urban areas. Climate change scenarios for the Salento region show us that temperatures will considerably increase in the future, hot days will become more frequent in number, rainfall patterns will be altered: it will rain less during the year, but heavy rainfall will increase and be produced by fewer, more intense events. These changes have several consequences for cities, where the microclimate is defined by urban heat islands, and where intense precipitation events can affect the urban drainage systems. These conditions can influence the health and welfare of urban residents, the security of urban infrastructures and the quality of the urban environment. There are many solutions to address these societal challenges, some of which are inspired and supported by nature. They are the so-called Nature Based Solutions and arise from the growing awareness that some of the most effective and robust responses to these issues are based on the use and developing of some of the features of natural ecosystems. Ultimately, it’s about “innovating with nature” to develop solutions that improve and implement the natural capital of our cities, avoiding its erosion and consumption. Putting in place this kind of responses to climate change means to also evaluate pros and cons, the costs in terms of economic and natural resources and the final benefits by an in-depth analysis taking into consideration all the useful perspectives to achieve a positive outcome. For that reason, Climathon Lecce launches a challenge focused on urban green spaces as a solution for a more resilient city in order to adapt to climate change and mitigate its impacts on cities. The city of Lecce encourages Climathon participants (experts, students, anyone who feels they can actively contribute) to propose ideas and solutions that imagine the green spaces as urban infrastructures which are able to improve conditions in cities while taking into account some specific phenomena correlated to climate change, such as urban heat islands and extreme precipitation events in urban areas. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/extreme-weather/the-urban-green-spaces-as-a-solution-for-climate-change-impacts;

Under the premise of transforming Lisbon towards a Zero-Carbon City, this year's Climathon has the objective in following through with the European Green Capital 2020 initiative, by planning tomorrow today, through the use of technology, in striving towards a more environmentally-friendly European Capital. In order to create alternative frameworks and solutions made available through technology and innovation, the challenge sets out to transform the city of Lisbon’s waste management processes — reduce, recycle and reuse plastic and food waste generated on a daily basis, and consequently left on the public pathways every evening. The main challenge in the city is waste reduction overall. Inside waste reduction Lisbon Municipality prioritizes plastic waste (overall reduction and increase in recycling rate). Another challenge is managing to engage citizens with recycling programs and waste reduction. Join us in designing a sustainable future for the City of Lisbon by bringing together citizens, businesses and public and private organizations to innovate, in line with the ever growing amount of knowledge associated to the circular economy-based solutions and smart cities. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/waste-management/let-s-reduce-recycle-reuse-the-produced-waste;

Major impact can be made by changing consumer behaviour - how people shop & consumer food in their homes. We have created a solution aligned with Portuguese Waste Management National Plan: foster citizenship & encourage community involvement and reduce urban waste production by 10 percent (2012-2020) and contribute towards United Nations SDGs. We have created Vida Verde Lisboa app, where we reward people for their ‘green’ habits, with most value placed on Reducing Consumption and behaviour change to become more environment conscious and aware. The food waste reduction and conscious meal planning also cuts costs for the consumer. That is a win-win situation for all stakeholders: App users (consumers), municipality and industry partners. The app is Collect and Redeem green points that is collected during sustainable food buying. Besides the motivational reward system, other solutions are made to enable users to create smart grocery list, get to know about delicious leftover recipes, do volunteering related to food rescue and donation and have up to date online compost locations within the city. While the Collect and Redeem system allows users to receive different partner offers and discounts, participate in green events, receive green devices etc. Industry partners would recieve tax reductions and going green tagline, municipality would become more sustainable. promote green city status by archievng Lisbon 2020 Green Capital goals and have cost reduction for the % of saved waste.

Trees are an important element of the city landscape. They contribute to green spaces in the city, they act as carbon sinks and reduce the heat island effect. Many of these trees are located on private property, where the owners have the right to cut them down. The trend among private owners in the last few years has been towards felling the trees in favour of parking spaces. Regardless of its policy towards increasing green spaces in Ljubljana, the municipality has no means to prevent such felling. Under this challenge we are looking for solutions on how to convince the private owners in Ljubljana to recognize the importance of the trees on their property for their private benefit and the benefit of the whole city in order to avoid tree felling. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/human-behaviour/ljubljana-green-spaces;

But how to encourage private owners of city's green areas in a way so that they do not built it heavily? Preserving Ljubljana's green zones Urbanization is inevitable. By 2020, 80% of the population is expected to live in cities. In order to preserve the quality of life, continuous cooperation of different levels is required. But how to encourage private owners of city's green areas in a way so that they do not built it heavily? Urbanization is inevitable. By 2020, 80% of the population is expected to live in cities. Urban life offers many opportunities but also traps. In order to preserve the quality of life, a continuous cooperation of different levels is required - from the individual, the local communities to the government on the one hand, and the economy on the other. The preservation of green urban oases is necessary for several aspects. In general, they can be summarized as healthy living conditions and they represent public health, cultural, educational, economic and psychological significance. The Ljubljana Municipality has more than half of the total area of green, of which only over one-third of the green areas are public. This means that almost 60% of the green areas are out of reach of spatial planning tools, which directly constitutes a threat to change into built-up areas. One of the possibilities to preserve green spaces on private land is the City LJubje Campaign. Through this awareness, private owners of green surfaces are urging to personalize trees. Such a commitment has a strong influence on the owners' future decisions about interventions on their property and directly affects the quality of living in cities. When the tree is entered in the map, the owner receives a table with the selected name. This is made from recycled plastic packaging. The mobile application also shows interesting calculations about the contributions of his tree (for example, the quantity of oxygen produced) and allows him to see other entries and benchmarks with other tree owners. Added value is also recognized at the tourist level, the empowerment of the entire urban population and the building of cultural heritage. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/mestno-ljubje;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/human-behaviour/ljubljana-green-spaces
london01;London;challenge;The Future of Urban Resource Management and the Circular Economy;How Can Sustainable Design Principles help Eliminate Single use Plastic Waste in London?;circular-economy;As cities continue to increase in number and size, business’s government and local authorities face increasing pressure to eliminate waste and improve resource management and efficiency. Research shows that improvements can lead to significant economic, social and environmental benefits. A major challenge for cites and the wider environment is the accumulation of plastic waste, especially single use plastic waste which is inherently difficult to manage in a sustainable manner due to the composite nature of the material finished product and insufficient collection, reprocessing and end of life uses available. The demand by consumers and producers for cheap, light, durable and versatile materials for packaging in particular but also for use in end products has led to plastic content becoming ubiquitous within urban settings and resource flows, however the value of materials is lost at best to landfill or incineration and at worst to polluting our seashores, rivers and ocean depths, which is compounded by the global environmental impacts that result in climate change, air and water pollution and the harm caused to wildlife in our oceans.  How can London together with industry and citizens eliminate plastic waste and transition from Waste Management systems to Resource Management Systems using culture, design, organisation and waste stream data? Good circular economy practice involves integrating sustainable design, production, distribution, consumption and disposal of materials back into the material and resource flows, and requires collaboration and co-creation between producers and consumers. At one extreme, it encompasses social and cultural practices with regards to decisions made regarding whether an activity is undertaken (e.g. food on the go), and haven decided that it is desirable, the other extreme then considers how can it be done in a manner which is complimentary to natural environmental and future resource flows (e.g. easily compostable or re-usable packaging, cutlery or materials). Solutions could focus on: Industry and sector specific challenges How can culture and “consumer” behaviour be integrated into the design, management, production processes, along the value-chain Design techniques using concepts or materials that embed circular flows or material efficiencies Identifying, capturing and using resource data that will inform and support a more sustainable use and management of resources. Using design and technology to add value and extend the useful life of current single use plastics Business models that can be adapted or created that will aid a transition to a circular economy Creation or development of local circular loops or economies Industrial symbiosis Distributed manufacture Co-creation opportunities between producers and consumers ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/circular-economy/the-future-of-urban-resource-management-and-the-circular-economy;

London Legacy Development Corporation set the Climathon challenge focusing on the future of urban mobility. Specifically, how developments in technologies can answer London’s key mobility issues: Climathon London 2017 was one of the bigger Climathons in the world. Participants came from a wide range of backgrounds, from post graduate students to business owners and web developers. 76 participants formed 12 teams. All 12 teams developed their own ideas throughout the 24 hours. The partners provided their expertise through 15 minute key note or drop in sessions. This ensured that well informed solutions were developed during the 24 hours, in areas of interest to key stakeholders across Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and London. Climathon London was one of 10 Climathon cities broadcast to all 104 cities during the event. This connected Climathon London to innovation centres and academic institutions around the world, putting a focus on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the urban mobility work developing on the Park. There were 18,900 Climathon related social media posts throughout the event, with a global reach of 33 million people. 12 innovative solutions were pitched after 24 hours of development to 4 judges: Jennifer Daothong, Head of Strategy and Sustainability, London Legacy Development Corporation Ben Boucher-West, Automotive Lead, Bosch Safia Barikzai, Engineering and Computer Science Lead, London South Bank University Chris Mazur, Mobility expert from Imperial College London and District Lead for Smart Sustainable Districts  After the high standard of pitches, the judging panel decided to crown two teams as Climathon London 2017 winners: Treko: Treko have developed a wearable device called “Co-Pilot”, initially for cyclists, providing real time information on connected vehicles around them. This device will enable cyclists to interact with autonomous vehicles safely. The data from the recorded interactions between cyclists and road vehicles can then be used to provide advice on safe cycling routes, hazards and road conditions, as well as being used by autonomous car manufacturers to improve the safety of their decision making algorithms. Treko were awarded with 1 years membership to Plexal to incubate and develop Treko.

lund01;Lund;challenge;New innovative solutions to limit the climate impact of plastic;How do we achieve a circular economy of plastic materials focusing on upstream prevention?;waste-management;Plastics are both a blessing and the cause of a lot of problems. How can we change our usage of plastics to keep the benefits while limiting the problems? Yearly around 280 million tonnes of plastic are created. Plastics are used in most product groups but the largest categories after packaging are buildings, automotive and electronics. Plastic is a very versatile and useful material with advantages in many areas. In many cases the alternative to plastics are expensive, less suitable and have large environmental disadvantages. At the same time, there are huge problems with our current extensive usage of plastic. Plastics commonly have fossil origin, which contributes to CO2 emissions in their end of life phase. Yet another problem is that many plastic materials release toxic substances and degrade into microplastics, with uncertain health effects that are widely spread in nature. Littering and plastic in the oceans are other well-known problems. In Sweden, packages fall under the producer responsibility, which leads to some material recovery of plastic consumer packages. However, the collection rate is low compared to other waste fractions, around 50%. A large share of the plastic packages that are collected are not recycled but incinerated. Plastic products other than consumer packages are not covered by producer responsibility. Of all the plastics used in Sweden, only 16% is recycled. The Swedish recycling rate is still high compared to the EU or globally. What makes recycling of plastics complicated is that there are many different types of plastic materials and also several additives, and they need to be separated into different recycling streams. Some types of plastic can be easily and profitably recycled while others are not recyclable, at least not with a reasonable economy compared to incineration. The five most common types of plastics are: PE (Polyethylene) the most common type of plastics used in packaging but also common in other applications. PE is easily recyclable. PP (Polypropylene) the second most common type of plastic used in packaging. Common in plastic films and food packages. PP is easily recyclable. PS (Polystyrene) frequently used in single use items and as insulation, both in packages and in the building sector. PS is expensive to recycle in relation to the value of the material. PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) This type of plastic is commonly used in the building sector due to its durability and inherent fire-retardant properties. It often contains unhealthy additives. PVC could be recycled if there were large quantities of it that did not contain too much additives. Currently PVC is a large obstacle for recycling when it is present in PE or PP material flows. PVC may release toxins when incinerated. PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) is used mostly for textiles such as fleece clothes but the second largest usage is plastic bottles. The bottles in the Swedish pant system can easily be recycled but other PET-fractions are recycled to a lower extent. Climathon in Lund will focus on finding solutions to limit the climate impact of plastic. To reach set targets we need new ideas and business solutions in a number of areas. Here are a few examples: Development of bio-based, plastics and finding sustainable feedstock’s for plastic materials Ways to decrease the usage of plastic materials / ways to encourage more sustainable use of plastic materials Digital solutions to track plastic materials through the entire value chain Design of circular material flows for plastic materials New sustainable product designs that can change our perception/behaviour on plastics. Solutions on how to reuse plastic items Ways to enable households and companies to better sort plastic waste Better solutions to sort collected plastic waste Ideas on how to expand recycling of plastics from packaging to building waste, automotive parts, electronics, textiles and other consumer items Business solutions that increase demand of reused plastics Note that we will also hold a panel debate on this topic with leading researchers and industry representatives 11/10 ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/waste-management/solutions-to-limit-the-climate-impact-of-plastic;

Working to protect the environment, Madrid has committed in its second action plan submitted to the Open Government Partnership to improve transparency in waste management and create a waste information platform so citizens can track, analyze, and understand how they can contribute to waste management. More information is available (in Spanish) at https://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/Madrid_Action-Plan_2018-2020.pdf In the context of this challenge, we will work towards proposing an initial information model that may be used for the storage and access of data related to waste management, according to what has been agreed in the action plan for Madrid. Our goal is to study the information that now has the city of Madrid on waste management in their portals of open data, the portal of the Department of Environment and any other official site, to see how much information is offered to the at the moment, and propose ideas on how you could model all the information related to this area so that they can serve to support the Waste Information Management System that appears in the action plan that Madrid has recently proposed for the Open Government Partnership. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/waste-management/towards-the-waste-information-platform-for-madrid;
madrid02;Madrid;challenge;Understanding light pollution in Madrid;Can we provide better information about light pollution in Madrid?;energy;In this challenge we will work on several activities related to generating a better understanding of light pollution in cities like Madrid, so that we can engage more people into fighting against it. Light pollution is excessive, poorly directed or unnecessary artificial light at night. Wastes energy and money. Affects the natural day-night/light-dark cycle under which all species and ecosystems on earth have evolved. Endangers night time habitats and disrupts natural rhythms (e.g. circadian and seasonal) of both diurnal and nocturnal species. Destroys the natural darkness of nocturnal landscapes and obscures the view of the star-filled sky. Disorients insects and other animals, thereby reducing ecosystem services. Affects human well-being and health through its association with insomnia, obesity, metabolic disorder and hormonal cancers. Potentially decreases safety due to glare. Causes annoyance and reduces privacy by obtrusive light. In this challenge we will explore how we can make sure that light pollution is better understood by all of us, including not only citizens but also public administrations who are in charge of public lighting plans. The list of activities will be released before the Climathon. The problem posed in this climathon is to reduce the consumption energy, and therefore the emission of CO2, from the systems of lighting, while minimizing the impact of artificial light on environment.  To find these solutions we will see some examples of system lighting, like the one displayed on our campus by CEDINT (https://www.cedint.upm.es/en/proyecto/living-lab-illumination). The participants can help us design a more complete system that allows to reach a solution to the problem posed.  But not only the technological aspect of the solution is important. The awareness of citizens (and administrations) is also key public) when it comes to addressing the problem. For this, it will be studied how citizen science can help a better understanding of problem, while educating in a responsible use of resources. He they will study examples like Cities At Night (http://www.citiesatnights.org), NightKnights (http://www.nightknights.eu) and Farolapp (http://farolapp.linkeddata.es) to later devise new applications that help in this task.  Finally, we will address the problem of data integration due to the heterogeneity of the sources. We will use sensor data from our network of photometers (http://tess-dashboards.stars4all.eu/), lighting points located in Open Street Map, photographs taken from the Station International Space of the Cities At Night project and notices from of the data portal of the Madrid City Council.

madrid03;Madrid;challenge;Improving data about air quality in Madrid;Can we provide better visualisations and a better organisation of data about air quality in Madrid?;air-pollution;In this challenge we will work with city officials from Madrid on how to organise and present better the data of the air (and weather) monitoring network that is being deployed in Madrid and will be operational before the end of 2018. Data about air quality in Madrid is already being made available in the corresponding Web portal (http://www.mambiente.munimadrid.es/opencms/opencms/calaire/) and in the open data portal of Madrid (http://datos.madrid.es). Currently Madrid is also deploying a rich air quality and weather monitoring network, which will be fully operational before the end of 2018. The challenge will be focused on how to better organise such data and make it available as open data, as well as on ideation processes about how to present such data to citizens. In this challenge we will work with city officials on several fronts: Understanding how to describe the data generated by the network of sensors so that it is easier to use by third party reusers when this data is made available in Madrid's open data portal. Proposing new ideas on how to visualise such data so as to make the most of the data that is being made available. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/improving-the-data-generated-by-air-quality-sensors-in-madrid;

The solution integrates several open datasets from the Open Data Portal from city council of Madrid and tweets from citizens reporting illuminated stores during closing hours. The trigger of this solution is the huge number of stores that keep their lights on during closing hours (i.e. an illuminated clothing store at 3.00 am). Apart from being a waste of energy, this situation causes over illumination issues, giving the fact that other light generators are also functioning during these hours (street lamps, bus stops, etc.); this over illumination situations are seriously harming for wildlife and humans.

Ir reduciendo la intensidad lumínica del alumbrado público hasta llegar al mínimo necesario. ¿Y cuál es el mínimo necesario? El que podemos calcular con la siguiente guía propuesta. Guía técnica para la reducción de la luminosidad en Madrid ¿CUÁL ES NUESTRA IDEA? Ir reduciendo la intensidad lumínica del alumbrado público hasta llegar al mínimo necesario. ¿Y cuál es el mínimo necesario? El que podemos calcular con la siguiente guía propuesta. El alumbrado público de las ciudades afecta directamente a la contaminación lumínica de las ciudades provocando graves alteraciones en el funcionamiento normal de todos los serves vivos que habitamos en estos ambientes. Según la campaña por los cielos oscuros, la buena iluminación brilla en el suelo donde se necesita, sin embargo la iluminación ha dejado en segundo plano la funcionalidad y se ha centrado en una simple cuestión cultural fomentando el derroche de energía innecesario. Por este motivo aparece esta necesidad de reducir lo máximo posible este gasto de energía para aumentar su eficiencia y asegurar el derecho de todos los seres vivos de disfrutar de la belleza de los cielos oscuros. Para empezar con la guía primero teníamos que considerar QUÉ VARIABLES afectan al valor de LUMINOSIDAD NECESARIA. A lo largo de este Climathon, hemos determinado que las variables básicas que afectan a este valor son: Coeficiente de criminalidad, transeúntes, accidentes de tráfico. TABLA DE PESOS: (*En este caso, todas las calles del área de estudio pertenecen al mismo distrito, por lo que la variable tiene el mismo valor en todas ellas. Estos pesos dependen de la subjetividad de la población, gobierno o persona que haga uso del desarrollo de esta guía, en función de la prioridad que aplique a cada una de las variables que se mencionan a continuación.) El coeficiente de criminalidad en este caso se basa en el número de detenciones de la policía municipal.El coeficiente de accidentes de tráfico es un factor que se considera importante como la criminalidad en cuanto al daño físico que puede producir a la población. Esto significa que a mayor tasa de accidentes mayor luminosidad y por tanto número de farolas debe tener la vía.El número de transeúntes es determinante a la hora de dictaminar cual es la cantidad de luxes necesarios por zona. En una zona muy transitada el riesgo de robo y la seguridad por medio de la violencia es bajo de manera que no necesitamos tanta luz. Por lo que aquí solo nos preocupa la visibilidad y no la seguridad, ya que el riesgo de atracos con violencia son 0. Lo ideal sería tener los valores de las variables anteriores por calle o como mínimo por barrio. Pero como hemos dicho, según los datos que tenemos, las variables son iguales en todas las calles por estar en el mismo distrito menos los transeúntes, que sabemos que es mayor en Gran Vía, Montera y Preciados. Nuestro prototipo es una porción del distrito de centro de Madrid, ya que debido a su localización y sus características resulta interesante como planteamiento. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/guia-tecnica-para-la-reduccion-de-la-luminosidad-en-madrid;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/energy/fighting-against-light-pollution-in-madrid

mandurah01;Mandurah;challenge;Managing Trees to Manage Change ;Can the responsible management of urban trees and gardens support our local wildlife and community? ;extreme-weather;"In a time of obvious climate change, increasing social change and continuing urban development; is the responsible management of urban trees and forests part of the habitat management solution and how do we get community buy in? Australia is one of seventeen ‘megadiverse’ countries that make up less than 10% of the global surface but support more than 70% of the earth’s diverse species. Western Australia’s South West, including Mandurah, is a noted international biodiversity hotspot; home to a number of endemic flora and fauna that are highly impacted by current changes to our natural environment. The City of Mandurah boasts Ramsar listed wetlands, plays host to a range of migratory shorebirds and is well known for the critical habitat it provides to vulnerable wildlife, including the western ringtail possum, black cockatoo and fairy fern. Recently, the Mandurah Environmental Volunteer Action Committee has identified that local wildlife plays an important role in connecting our community with nature and is passionate about ensuring these animals have the best chance for continued survival. An identified hurdle for local fauna is the decline in available habitat, particularly trees. While the City of Mandurah has designated tree protection areas in areas of environmental significance, more can be done to increase the percentage of urban tree canopy. This would be of benefit to both our local community in reducing the impact of urban heat island effect, and our wildlife, by providing them with additional opportunities for foraging, nesting, roosting and protection from predators. The City of Mandurah encourages Climathon participants to propose ideas and solutions to encourage local residents, businesses and organisations to get involved managing urban tree health, to reduce the rate of decline in local trees and increase wildlife corridors and creating fauna-friendly gardens.

marbella01;Marbella;challenge;Facing new urban mobility models with electric technologies.;How can we promote the use of new mobility models with emphasis on the use of electric technologies?;air-pollution;Developing sustainable mobility models with an emphasis on environmental issues is a great challenge of social innovation. Marbella is already working on this with its Strategic Plan which prioritizes pacification of traffic, the reduction of motorized traffic and the promotion of electric mobility. The Marbella Strategic Plan is an instrument developed through public participation and consensus, and reflects each and every association, expert, technician and institutional and public board which has manifested itself in a series of impressions on the needs and possible solutions that Marbella must embrace in order to face the future in a rational way. A future city model that both the city in general and all the different political parties must unite around for the common good. An Urban Strategic Plan is simply a vision of the city that we all want as citizens. A long-term model of a city we would like to live in and pass on to future generations. An urban quality space that allows for economic and social development in way that is sustainable over time while preserving its natural and cultural heritage. There is a clear public demand for sustainable mobility. The sustainable mobility strategy has been widely supported during the participation process as one of the most demanded priorities for the city. Creating a more friendly, sustainable and vertebrate city as a guiding principle that advocates non-motorised uses in the modal use hierarchy. Sustainable mobility means ensuring that our transport systems meet our economic, social and environmental needs while minimizing their negative impact. It is aimed towards improving public transport and the pedestrian conditions of urban space and the commitment to non-motorised means of transport, achieving a balance between the urban roles of employment, residence, tourism, leisure and trade. They play a key role in this public policy strategy to promote the criterion of proximity, favouring a compact city development in terms of its structure as a support for the different urban uses, and diverse and complex in terms of developing the roles and uses generated within it. Part of this goal is also to create several centralities within the city where the principle of proximity of the residence-employment-leisure roles is present. Some actions are provided: Programme for the improvement and promotion of local public transport and a Metropolitan Transport Consortium based in Marbella. Promote traffic pacification and reduction within the city through active and passive policies. Measures for the location and construction of public parkings to deter the access to the consolidated city, with connection to public transport and non-motorised modes. Promote cycling not only as a leisure activity but as a common form of transport within the city. Create bicycle lanes in new sectors and interconnect them with the existing network, which must be comprehensive throughout the municipality and complemented with bicycle-parking areas and a local bicycle-hiring system. Measures for the renewal of the fleet of municipal vehicles and their replacement with non-polluting vehicles. Measures for the implementation of areas with a maximum speed limit of 30 km/h inside the consolidated city. Awareness-raising campaign for sustainable mobility and the proper use of the different means of transport. Participants are encouraged to provide solutions to assist in decision making on urban mobility within this context. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/air-pollution/facing-new-urban-mobility-models-with-electric-technologies;

One of the potentialy interesting solutions is production of biochar. Biochar can be introduced into substrate or it could be potentially have other applications (e.g. building materials). Biochar is known to be a very good carbon sink in agriculture and can transform a field from a carbon emitter to a carbon sink. These experiences would now be transferred to the urban environment. Green roofs and walls are becoming more and more vital for urban landscapes, as they have a multifaceted benefits.

murviel-les-montpellier01;Murviel-lès-Montpellier;challenge;Local solutions to adapt vineyards to climate change;How can a village maintain its vineyards by mobilizing its local resources?;food;Murviel's vineyards are exposed to draughts and heat waves that are more and more frequent. Like for other villages in the South of France, connection with an irrigation network is impossible. Vine growers are seeking solutions... and Murviel wants to join this effort! Climate change has major impacts on vineyards in the Mediterranean basin. Harvests happen earlier and harvest conditions are made more difficult by the heat. Indeed while while rains are becoming rare, the need for water increases in vineyards. Moreover, plots are subject to erosion phenomenons, worsened by more frequent extreme climatic events, especially in autumn.Many vineyards, like in Murviel-lès-Montpellier, are located in hillside areas. The soil is shallow, stony and conains few organic matter. Both surface and deep water resources are reduced in summer. These territories cannot benefit from extensions of the local collective water network. They are also the most sensitive to the risk of fire and erosion.These territories are classified through geographical indications. Viticulture plays an important role in rural municipalities. It contributes to the local economy and employment, while maintaining the landscape and encouraging rural tourism. Considering the current expansion of fallow lands, vines have a major role in preventing fires. Viticulture, through its growing committment into organic agriculture, also contributes to biodiversity in landscapes made up of mosaics of vineyards, olive trees, woods, scrubland and other crops.2000 people are living in Murviel-lès-Montpellier. It has 150 hectares of vineyards, managed by 8 domains, and other grape growers that are members of 2 wine cooperatives. Murviel is a typical example of a rural vine-growing municipality in the South of France. A major part of its territory is located in the watershed of the Mosson river, and it is only 15 km from the Mediterranean Sea.Vine-growers have begun to modify their practices to adapt to climate change: planting later and choosing drought-resistant grape varieties, incorporating compost into the soil and managing the environment ... They shared their concerns with elected officials and their representatives in professional organizations. For this Climathon, we want to relay their concerns, and promote the search for local solutions. The global challenge is to find solutions by mobilizing local resources (biomass, water, soil, know-how ...) but also scientific and technical knowledge available. Within this frame, different paths for adaptation can be mentionned. In order to start and feed this 24-hours event, a few questions have been pre-identified and validated with stakeholders. How can vine varieties evolve in the territory? Grape varieties, locations, rhythms and methods of planting ... How can we build water reserves for summer irrigation in hillside areas? Collection of run-off water, treated water from the water treatment plant, groundwater, buffer zones ... How can we change vineyard management in a sustainable way? Pruning, foliage management, soil management, fight against diseases and pests ... How can we create a circular economy of biomass on the territory, for viticultural soils? compost, crushed branches from local woods, manure ... How can we manage agroforestry in vineyard hills? Species and management methods, intra or inter-plots, advantages and disadvantages, landscape quality, carbon capture and microclimate ... How can we rehabilitate terraces and traditional facilities to retain and regulate water and soil? Possible new technologies... What digital tools to manage information and climate risk at the scale of a hillside watershed? How can we mobilize elected representatives and public policies to financially support the implementation of these solutions? These challenges contribute to the construction of solutions and a global vision that is sustainable for the municipality of Murviel, but also for the other viticultural villages of the Languedoc regional indication. What global strategy can we build by identifying the links between all these tracks? ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/food/sauvons-la-viticulture-quelles-solutions-locales;

Intelligent Traffic Monitoring and Vehicle Emission Monitoring 1. Use a RFID system mechanism interlinked with traffic signals and cctv, this remote sensing technology at various points in the city will help detecting the emmisions produced by cars. Problem Statement: Cutting down the pollution caused by vehicles, a major cause of pollution in delhi. What is the problem? At times when the Delhi Government is taking all possible measures to deal with the menace of pollution with contingency plans already set in motion to combat it, a scientific study has revealed that 41 percent of the pollution in Delhi is contributed by “transport sector”. The number of registered vehicles in Delhi has crossed the mark of One crore. Problem caused majorly: The increase in pollution from the transport sector could be because of a four-fold increase in the number of registered vehicles in Delhi in the last eight years, but the problem has been aggravated by the rise in number of car transport services, scientists highlighted. Poor design standards of roads. Less staff in traffic department. Less data points and poor decision making. Already being done? The odd even concept launched by Delhi government. Delhi has already commenced selling BSVI compliant fuel. Most cars introduced in the recent past are already BSVI compliant. Older cars would be permitted to operate till they complete 15 years. Thereafter such BSIV cars would not be given extensions as is being done now. Overall people would breathe less toxic air in their cities. Diesel cars older than 10 years will be banned. Petrol cars older than 10 years will be banned. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system --which weighs trucks and commercial vehicles coming into Delhi, registers their origin/destination, nature of goods being carried, and deducts taxes automatically. RFID mandated in all new cars in a ruling of 2016. What is going well? The SDMC corporation will gradually make it mandatory for commercial vehicles to get RFID tags. This will help prevent entry of vehicles older than 10 years, which have been barred by the Supreme Court. 1000 cr already sactioned by governor to use AI in traffic monitoring. Issuing challan using the cctv footage etc. Traffic in Delhi has a pattern. There are some areas where traffic is very heavy on certain days while other roads remain underutilised. Currently, our traffic inspectors use their experience to stop or divert traffic during peak hours but with the data in place from cameras live feeds, sensors, even Google maps, the AI will make a predictive algorithm.

nova-gorica01;Nova Gorica;challenge;Seeds are Life.;How can we scale up Agrobiodiversity?;extreme-weather;"In a time of climate change, biodiversity is what we need to assure food security & resilience. Seed Library is an effective mechanism for collecting and distributing seeds. The goal of Seed Library is to protect biodiversity in food system and promote public access to seeds. For millennia, people the world over have selected the best edible plants, saved the seeds, and planted and shared them in sophisticated, locally adapted breeding projects that created the vast array of foods we rely on today. In a time of climate change, biodiversity is what we need to assure food security and resilience. Community seed libraries are an effective mechanism for collecting and distributing seeds. The goal of community seed libraries is to protect biodiversity in food system and promote public access to seeds. Why are community seed libraries important? The purpose of the community seed libraries is to protect seed diversity of edible species and to maintain heritage varieties. Community seed libraries help communities save seeds while adapting them to local soils and climates. This has become more critical in a changing climate. Saving seeds by growing them out and exposing them to the fast-changing environment, increases our adaptability as well as the resilience of our food systems. We also want to save heritage seeds so they are not lost. Seed viability of stored seeds can decrease over time, so we need to keep growing them out to produce fresh seeds to save. Why is our community, our public library, city and municipality itself interested in a community seed library? Some people want to grow their own vegetables because they want to know where their food comes from. Some people want to grow their own food to save money. Community seed sharing ties in nicely with the mission of community gardens, especially in urban areas. Gardens can help to combat climate changes – particularly if they are in the city. This is a brief summary of key areas in which gardens can also make a difference to changing climate: Increasing the presence of vegetation will increase the water infiltration capacity of the soil, which in turn leads to better adaptation to future needs in terms of storm water runoff. By providing shade, increasing evapotranspiration and transforming sunlight into vegetal material in photosynthesis processes rather than absorbing it, plants and trees have a cooling effect on their environment. When using more drought-tolerant plants, water needs for irrigation can be reduced. Because of the increased water infiltration, capacity the groundwater table will rise improving drought resistance. When planting more saline vegetables and drought-tolerant vegetation there will be more food available during dry spells. Urban farming and gardening attract a variety of fauna and thereby increases local biodiversity. Moreover, gardens are used as recreational areas and public meeting places for people, improving the environmental qualities of urban At our first Nova Gorica Climathon we will work towards developing the first community seed library in Slovenia. Community seed libraries are an effective mechanism for collecting and distributing a variety of heirloom, rare, and culturally important seeds that are typically not available from seed companies. The goal of community seed libraries is to protect genetic diversity in our food system and promote public access to seeds. Initially, seeds are donated and collected at library, and then community members can check seeds out and grow them on the condition that a portion of the freshly grown seeds will be donated back to the library. These seeds are then stored and made available to others who continue to contribute to this cycle of taking seeds, growing them and donating a portion back to keep the collection viable, healthy and fresh. The main function of community seed libraries centers on the protection and public access to seeds; however, we will also run training days and workshops so that community members who may be interested in starting their first garden or learning how to hand pollinate squash can learn these skills and put them into practice. In terms of climate changes, community seed libraries are directly connected to urban farming and gardening. As we know areas used for urban farming and gardening, when compared to paved or asphalted grounds, have a positive contribution to climate adaptation. These green areas can be further adapted to climate impacts by introducing appropriate vegetation and crops for allotment and vegetable gardens. They should be, according to the climatic area resistant to droughts; such as saline vegetables and drought-tolerant plants and trees. Honored process of saving and sharing seeds is dynamic. It naturally adapts to changing conditions, like climate change, and keeps the power with people everywhere to make choices that assure local resilience. The seed in its essence is all of the past evolution of the Earth.

Seed Library is an effective mechanism for collecting and distributing seeds. The goal of Seed Library is to protect biodiversity in food system and promote public access to seeds. Just as traditional libraries enrich a community by providing a way to share books, seed libraries enrich the gardening community by allowing gardeners to share seeds. There are many parallels. Seed libraries offer a more efficient way to deploy community resources. They encourage experimentation, affording gardeners (or aspiring gardeners) a low-risk way to try something new. They provide a supported entrance into the gardening world for novices. And seed libraries support a kind-of botanical literacy, teaching people what different plants look like and how they grow.

novi-sad01;Novi Sad;challenge;Achieving green growth in Balkan’s secondary cities;How can innovation help Novi Sad and its citizens move to the green growth path?;energy;Being hubs of economic activity, cities consume majority of global energy and generate the bulk of GHG emissions. Cities, thus, should play a vital role in sustainability transition. Current patterns of urban development that are highly unsustainable, such as, inefficient use of resources, unsustainable mobility and housing made environmental footprint of Novi Sad alarming and led Novi Sad to be one of the cities with highest level of air pollution. Climate change mitigation and greening Novi Sad is therefore a key challenge. How may young people and innovative technology solutions support a sustainable urbanization of Novi Sad? Solutions could focus on (but not limited to): Sustainable housing and low emission infrastructure Sustainable urban mobility for greener cities Smart and safe cities through new technologies and digitalization Circular economy: managing waste as a resource Mainstreaming green growth into urban management Technology proposed as part of solutions to help Novi Sad and its citizens move to the green growth path while urbanizing, needs to be replicable to other cities of Serbia and other countries in the Balkans. Solutions that are coming from 24 hours workshop should be bankable. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/energy/smart-cities;
orleans01;Orléans;challenge;Flood risk: how to face it?;Flood risk: how to face it?;extreme-weather;Extreme weather, due to climate change, will be more intense and common. For our territory, flood risk is the major threat. We need to invent new ways to deal with that as we know that our further plans or organization did not include climate change impact. Orléans Metropole is crossed by the Loire, the last savage river in Europe. Major floods during 19th century have stayed in memories. Even if no major event occured in 20th century, territories led studies in order to describe and understand the risk, wrote plans and built equipments to protect the population. In may 2016, our ground, totally saturated by winter rains, was unable to absorb a 2-day rain more than centennial. Rain-flood concerned aeras where no plan, no building levees had been imaginated until then. 2500 inhabitants were evacuated, 1150 houses flooded, trafic on a national major motorway stopped for a week (68 000 vehicles recorded by day, with a huge part of trucks), our metropole isolated from the rest of the country for about 48 hours… It was a real shock! Then, we realized: climate change will increase our vulnerability in front of that kind of disaster. Mayors of the 22 cities included in the metropole decided to write together a global plan to enhance our resilience capacities but also to decrease our carbon impact. But there are still so much questions before becoming resilient: how can we predict rain-flood, how can we drecrease our vulnerability, how can we product integrated city plan, how can we enhance our crisis management by a better coordination between all the actors? We are at the beginning of our resilience process and need expert’s report to accelerate. We are fully open-minded! Our goal, through Climathon, is to invent and create new ways of dealing with flood risk. Resilient buildings, digital solutions to forecast or monitor, nature based solutions, citizens education, ... and so others ways can be investigated. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/extreme-weather/flood-risk-how-to-face-it;

pireas01;Piraeus;challenge;Fishing marine litter (macroplastics) to recycle/reuse in Piraeus;How can we shift to a circular economy?;circular-economy;New technologies, coordinated action of various actors at local level can help shift to a circular economy. Combined, they can stimulate fishermen to fish marine litter (macroplastics) and bring them to shore while creating recycling/reuse opportunities at city level. How can new technologies, coordinated action of various actors at local level and a shift to circular economy be combined to stimulate fishermen to fish macroplastics and bring them to shore while creating recycling/reuse opportunities at city level? Marine litter is mismanaged waste, resulting mainly from activities in coastal regions. Over 80% of marine litter is plastic, and is further divided in “macroplastics”, waste of size between 5mm-1m, and “microplastics” which are particles smaller than 5mm. Globally, 5 to 13 million tonnes of plastics end up in the oceans every year. As global plastic production increases each year, 33 billion tons of plastic are expected to pile up around the globe by 2050. In the EU, the yearly amount of plastic marine litter is 150.000 to 500.000 tonnes, which is equal to 66.000 rubbish trucks. Global frameworks and policies are putting forward efforts to reduce the ecological, human health and economic impacts of marine litter which, apart from  harming the environment, causes economic damage to activities such as tourism, fisheries and shipping. The SDGs 6, 11, 12 and 14 have set targets relevant to marine plastic pollution: clear water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, life below water. Similarly, the EU committed  itself to “prepare a strategy addressing the challenges posed by plastics throughout the value chain and taking into account their entire life-cycle”. Piraeus has set a strategic vision for Blue Growth, main axes of which are: developing skills and knowledge in Blue Economy sectors, supporting entrepreneurship, smart infrastructures, providing information to the public and raising awareness. The challenge aims to develop solutions that make a tangible contribution to a sustainable, low carbon, resource efficient and competitive city, based on circular economy. Making  this transition a reality and turning current challenges into future opportunities will require collaborative, decisive action from a variety of urban actors (private sector, civil society, the scientific community, local government departments) as well as stakeholders in the plastic value chain, from plastic producers and designers, to recyclers. How can Piraeus mobilize actors, existing resources and technology in order to stimulate coordinated stakeholders’ action, tackle the challenge of marine litter, and move towards a circular economy for sustainable local development? Citizens should be educated on how to reduce their plastic waste, reuse and recycle plastic. Raising awareness and providing opportunities for recycling and reuse eventually can lead to a circular approach to plastics. The recycling of plastic provides fertile ground for social innovation and entrepreneurship worldwide, and entrepreneurs see the need for determined action on plastic waste as a business opportunity. New companies provide circular solutions, such as reverse logistics for packaging or alternatives to disposable plastics, utilizing the endless possibilities of digitization. 1: Prevention of plastic marine litter Creative and innovative plastic waste collection and separation systems Reduction of single use plastics Reduction of plastic packaging disposal by industry and retailers 2: Collection of plastics in the sea Collaborative and innovative multi-stakeholder action Collection and sorting Digitalization Provision of incentives 3: Recycling/reuse of plastic marine litter Entrepreneurship and innovation towards circular solutions Introduction of new technologies Economics and quality of plastics recycling Collect plastic from the sea Move towards a circular economy (reduce, reuse, recycle, redesign, recover) Drive investment towards circular solutions Harness local collaborative action and stimulate improved waste management Promote the use of recycled plastics Increase awareness and prevent plastics from reaching the sea ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/circular-economy/pireas-challenge;

This system work because a secret and innovative technology holds by our partener. Protect nature with a natural phenomenon. Water cleaning of nano/micro particoles with controlled cavitation machine. This system work because a secret and innovative technology holds by our partener. Cavitation is a physical phenomenon, known as of the end of the ‘800. It consists in the formation within a liquid, a few microseconds, microscopic spherical-toroidal bubbles having thousands of degrees Celsius temperature and hundreds atmosphere (BAR) pressure, with localized liquid jet speeds over 100 m/s.  This blistering has very short duration and it normally occurs due to the reduction of pressure values lower than the vapour pressure of the liquid itself. Because of this, the liquid undergoes in a fast, a transformation into gas, forming in fact bubbles (otherwise known as ""micro cavity"").  The succession of formation and implosion of ""micro cavity"" generates, in turn, a sequence of shocks or ultrasounds. The process of formation of ""micro cavity"", alias  cavitation phenomenon, occurs primarily where is maximum speed of fluid: the liquid mass loses the continuity giving rise to a ""foam"", particularly rich in oxygen. This foam, if the cavitation is uncontrolled, can be extremely erosive and corrosive with metals.  The quick collapse of ""micro cavity"" generates micro-jets having very high pressure and  high concentrations of energy in a very short time and very narrow space, so  if these micro –jets are not controlled as described above, they can lead to damage, injury into  piping and/or moving parts of machines that trigger this phenomenon. At the contrary in the cavitation phenomenon, is the liquid pressure to drop suddenly, remaining constant temperature and vapor pressure. For this reason the ""bubble"" generated by cavitation  resistants only until it exits the area of low hydrostatic pressure: just it returned to an area of the static fluid, vapor pressure is not enough to counter the hydrostatic pressure and cavitation bubble implodes, releasing a large amount of energy and its sequence of shock waves. Cavitation, when it takes place in a controlled manner, does not generate nor damage or wear. DESCRIPTION Our machinery is equipped with test certificates and international credentialing of working with different types of liquids on different chemical, physical and biological processes. This specimen differs from the models intended for rental or sale solely for the fact that it was built as a ""closed loop"", that is a stand alone  system, able then to work disconnected from any other apparatus and therefore equipped with tanks, pumps, connecting pipes and additional electronic control systems designed to calibrate the models intended to be supplied to customers with values perfectly calibrated to process the test material samples, brought by themselves. What makes our system, at the present, an unicum, if compared to what the market offers in the field of controlled cavitation, is the fact that although it is already extremely difficult to control a cavitation, within our apparatus we are developed three types of spatially controlled cavitations, one of which is a Sonic kind.  The three phenomena of contemporary and synergistic cavitations,  coexisting  each with other in a totally harmonic way, to the point that there are no significant vibration. These synergistic phenomena further improve chemical processes efficiency and implement physical and biological agents that take place inside the apparatus. This special monobloc mixer tap, in the presence of processes covering the formation of crystalline chemical elements, has the ability to encourage the formation of crystals seeds, with further acceleration of chemical reactions. Further sensible improvement than our upgrade devices  present on the market , is the lower pressure drop than other machines equipped with similar installed capacity engines ,  resulting in energy saving in the exercise.

That represents about 5% of Iceland's annual total emissions in 2013 and more than 8% from emissions emitted from activities covered by the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

Food products will be sold at a much cheaper price by different sellers. Soko Food Market to reduce the carbon footprint from food wastage Idea is to sell food that is going to be disposed of by the suppliers because of defective packaging or nearing expiration date but the food is still fit for human and animal consumption. Food products will be sold at a much cheaper price by different sellers. Alot of food is disposed of from upstream supply chain of food products. Food suppliers or manufacturers throw away food that is about to be expired or that has a small packaging defect before the food is transported to the wholesalers or retailers for sale to the public. This food that has been disposed of is still good for consumption. It is disposed of because it may spoil while still on the shelves at the supermarkets or shops and also the packaging may not be appealing to the consumer because of a slight defect. All this food wasted adds on to the greenhouse gas emissions of Iceland from landfills. This carbon footprint can be reduced and there is a sustainable solution Soko has come up with, on how to help combat food wastage and emissions to the environment as well as create jobs while saving our city. Soko's proposal is to have a big food market that can host many stalls where different sellers can procure food products of their choice from food suppliers or manufacturers and sell them at a very low price to the public. Cheaper than the normal market price of that product. The individual sellers will go and get the food that was meant for disposal but still fit for human and animal consumption for free from the suppliers or manufacturers. Because they get the products for free, they have to sell it at a low price. This is how the sellers can earn some profit from the sale of their products. It would also be a good idea to have a price regulator or regulation. The sellers will pay a small fee for a stall space and also transport the food products to the market. The suppliers or manufacturers that agree to take part in this project; will be doing this for a good cause in a bid to help reduce their company's carbon footprint and they will be publicly recognised as being eco-friendly and environmentally conscious of their carbon footprint. This will help in convincing them to come on board with the idea of giving away their to-be-disposed-of food products as this eco-friendly image will also market their other for-sale products. Soko food market will be advertised as selling food products from companies that have agreed to help in reducing their carbon footprint. The customer target for this food market will be for; people on a low budget e.g students, asylum seekers, some tourists and Icelandic residents/citizens. people who care for the environment and want to promote the cause for a greener and a more environmentally sustainable city. This solution is a win-win situation for all as it will help in food waste management, reduce the carbon footprint from food disposal landfills, have more eco-friendly companies, provide cheaper food options and at the same time create jobs.

Valmiera is the largest city of the historical Vidzeme region, Latvia, with a total area of 18.1 square kilometres. As national significance development centre Valmiera plays a vital role as administrative, economic, industrial, trade and service centre. Therefore services and infrastructure provided by Valmiera are essential for town residents and for population from surrounding areas (~50 km) but there are no relevant data that shows mobility of citizens to and from Valmiera city what could help to development of the city and improve provided services. There are several ways how to analyse data about mobility of citizens but most of the times data do not give an overview about real situation, therefore it is needed to analyse data covering larger area (50-100km).

Precise NDVI prediction using Deep Learning Utilization of deep learning allows to make use of various spatio-temporal satellite data and weather data to forecast NDVI index important for insurance and agriculture industries. Climate is changing, due to increasing population and properties density risks for insurers are going higher. Insurers and reinsurers require precise models for weather phenomens prediction. One of the imporant parameters is NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index), prediction of which is used in different insurance products. Deep learning (DL) was successfuly applied in different areas helping to significantly reduce amount of subject matter experts manual labour required for data preprocessing, hidden correlation discovery and classical statistics based or machine learning based models. We have succesfully tested DL model to outperform classical model which was using historical NDVI index data to predict NDVI index for next year. Research literature highlights intercorrelations between multiple weather parameters (like temperature at ground level, precipitation, soil moisture and others) and NDVI index. Manual incorporation of abovelisted weather parameters into unified weather model is complex and timeconsuming task. To address this problem we have created DL model capable of predicting NDVI index based on multiple parameters (measurements), than can possibly be taken on different time-steps (for example one measurement can be taken every 10 days and other every 16 days). Thus our model capable of incorporation of unlimited amount of data representing various weather parameters. Moreover developed model seems to be highly generalizable and can be applied for different time-series data. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/forecasting-spatio-temporal-multi-channel-satellite-data-using-deep-learning-methods;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/extreme-weather/sustainabile-urban-infrastructure

rome01;Rome;challenge;Urban resilience;How can we make Rome more resilient to climate change? ;extreme-weather;Rome is the first city in Italy to adopt an ambitious Resilient Strategy in collaboration with 100 Resilient Cities. The Resilience Strategy will also allow Rome to implement integrated solutions to cope with Climate Change. Proactive citizens are an invaluable resource to achieve such goals. Rome faces severe climatic impacts related to its heat island, whose negative effects are intensified by high traffic density. Moreover, heavy precipitations can cause frequent flooding and exert strong pressure on the system of its critical infrastructures. Its complex urban fabric seems to be particularly sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation regimes can exacerbate the negative interactions between the urban heat island and pollution, heat waves and very local convective precipitation phenomena. On the other hand, the level of risk to critical infrastructures can rise significantly due to the increased frequency and intensity of extreme events. A major issue introducing further complexity is the fragility of the territory and the presence of the largest Cultural Heritage in the world: these facts act as constraints which reduce the possibility of providing breakthrough solutions to Rome’s problems. In particular, existing historical and architectural settings demand specific attention to their conservation. Complex problems magnified by complex constraints provide an extraordinary test bench for new ideas on mitigation and adaptation policies against climate change. The key objective of Climathon Rome is finding new ideas for coping with climate change-enhanced impacts. It addresses the mitigation of the heat island, pollution reduction (mostly that induced by vehicular traffic), the protection from flash floods impacting on the system of critical infrastructure. Ideas for novel solutions will be solicited from citizens, particularly young people, from the research and the academic communities, and from the industrial sector. Entrepreneurial action will be stimulated to drive and support innovation and policy design, and responsible citizenship promoted to make change happen. Contributions should address (but not be limited to) the following questions: How can green areas contribute to mitigating heat island effects? How can public transport become more efficient and reduce the large use of private transport? How can impacts of extreme events (flash floods, heat waves) be reduced by improving preparedness and resilience? How can innovative monitoring systems support the reduction of urban pollution?  ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/extreme-weather/new-ideas-for-a-climate-resilient-city;

rovereto01;Rovereto;challenge;Slow Mobility in Rovereto;How can we support road sharing by motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians in Rovereto city?;mobility;"Rovereto administration wants to promote cycling and slow mobility in general, including the theme of “pedestrianlity” and architectural barriers. Not only in terms of more bike and pedestrian routes, but also with a series of measures fostering more trips by bike and on foot. By the Decree n° 18/2016 the Municipality of Rovereto set the speed limit of 30 km/h on all urban roads except in some streets (the main corridors) where the limit of 50 km/h remains. The Municipality has defined as ""residential areas"" all the roads subjected to 30 km/h speed limit, not affected by the passage of public transport. The model ""50/30"" is very used at European level to define, through a classification of the roads, a different hierarchy between the different means of transport in the use of the road spaces. The limit of 30 km/h reduces accidents, improves the perception of safety of pedestrians and cyclists, improves the liveability perceived by residents. Law January 11, 2018, No. 2 ""provisions for the development of mobility on bicycles and the implementation of the national cycling Network of walkability"" (so-called ""framework Law on cycling mobility"") supports this concept. The Law represents a new important reference that, for the first time in Italy, establishes the importance of a policy of promotion of the bicycle as an ideal means of transport not only for tourist and recreational activities but also for systematic movements in the cities. Among the various significant cues introduced by the law, a particular emphasis is put in the definition of ""Ciclovia"" as a ""safe and comfortable"" path for bicycles. Among the types of paths that can be called ""cycloways"" the law introduces ""Roads 30"" and ""residential areas"". The principle of traffic moderation can often be quickly implemented through low-cost interventions. In some cases it is necessary to associate the implementation with more complex interventions involving a more substantial overall requalification of the road. In both cases it is advisable to associate to the measures to impose the speed limit of 30 km/h also ""physical"" interventions on the roadway able to guarantee that the limit is respected. In many of the urban contexts, typically the neighborhoods but also the historical centres, this creates the conditions for which the realization of cycle paths dedicated (""separated"" or ""segregated"") not only does not serve, but is even discouraged, because it limits the permeability of the road compared to pedestrian and cycle movements. On the contrary, ""integration"" of different means of transport, if well supported by the interventions on the road, represents a winning policy, able, more generally, to improve quality and safety. This paradigm shift needs to be well communicated to the citizens, who must empower themselves and educate themselves to mutual respect. It is not a question of staging a war between motorists, pedestrians and cyclists (all people are depending on the means they choose) but rather to implement policies and initiatives to educate the responsibility and mutual respect between road users. The participants will discuss the different types of ""material"" interventions on the road and ""intangible"" marketing interventions of sustainable mobility that can find effective implementation in Rovereto and in general in the cities. The success of these policies is often dictated also by the ability to engage and directly empower citizenship on the subject. These processes can exploit the innovative potential of urban regeneration initiatives, the development of Community neighbourhood relations, and pilot interventions.

rovereto02;Rovereto;challenge;Promotion of public transport in Vallagarina;How can we promote the use of public transport in Vallagarina?;mobility;"Strengthening of Public transport is a strategic axis of the new Urban Mobility Plan of Rovereto (“PUM”). Relevant investments have been planned starting from 2018. In which way can the administration address and support strengthened public transport offering to increase public transport users? Local public transport in Rovereto has developed over the years, from urban transport service in the city of Rovereto towards transport service for the entire territory surrounding the city (Vallagarina). Service users have increased over the years, till 2013. In 2014 and 2015 users decreased. Students represent 70% of the users, whereas workers use the service sporadically.Public transport covers 12% of urban travels, and 31% of travels from outside the city (8% by train).Modal shift from private motorised means of transport to public transport positively impacts on the quality of traffic, in particular if the strengthened public transport service will be perceived as competitive by the workers, responsible of those systematic flows that afflicts traffic during more critical rush hours. Strengthening of public transport means making it appealing to users in terms of frequency, seating capacity, speed, timeliness, comfort, information, accessibility. In order public transport can contribute to the achieving of the objectives of a more sustainable mobility, it is necessary to give it desirable characteristics in terms of frequency, capacity, speed, regularity, comfort, accessibility and information. Our recent review of the Public Transport Mobility Plan related to the area around the city of Rovereto has shown that the acquisition of new users is attainable by improving frequency and service on some high potential demand routes between the suburbs and the city centre (""strong axes""). Thanks to additional resources this enhancement will be implemented already since 2018. It is really important that our commitment in terms of service improvement produces a a real increase in users and a corresponding reduction in private motorised traffic, both for environment and human health objectives and to reduce the pressure of cars on the centre of the city. To achieve these objectives, in addition to strengthening the transport offer, indirect measures can be investigated (e.g.: discouraging parking in the city centre, traffic restrictions, services for modal interchange, etc.) or measures of to facilitate paradigm change (mobility management, information to users, communication, incentives, etc.).Furthermore, innovative and flexible forms of public transport service can be studied and eventually tested at a pilot level.

rovereto03;Rovereto;challenge;Limiting cars in the Rovereto city centre;How can we share with citizens a process of limiting cars in the center of Rovereto?;mobility;"The centre of Rovereto is an attractive place. The pressure of traffic on the incoming roads and on parking lots is strong. Reduce this pressure without loosing attractiveness particularly pertains to the economic activities that operate there, but also the residents, the workers, the ""City users"". In recent years the city of Rovereto has considerably widened the offer of car parking lots located in strategic positions around the city centre: from the oldiest historical parking ""Rovereto Centro"" in Via Manzoni, ""Historical center"" of Via dei Colli, "" Station ""of Via Riva,"" Follone ""of Piazzale Leoni (enlarged in the years), to the more recent parking ""City Hall"", the parking"" Urban City"", the Parking ""Hospital ""and the future – it will be completed soon - parking lots ""ex Bimac""and ""Palazzo Balista"". The city centre provides about 2000 parking stalls with additional payment (currently) and 1200 stalls in car parks (currently and under planning). At the same time, the ZTL (“Limited Traffic Zone”) has been enlarged with flexible access conditions in terms of time slots (e.g. Tartarotti Street with ZTL nocturnal) and, recently, a series of road regulations have been issued contextual to the substantial redevelopment of the public space of via Dante, with the aim of reducing the impacts of vehicular traffic in the most precious areas of the center. Finally, measures regarding the regulation of the parking system are being studied, in the hypothesis of an incremental implementation. Promoting ""intelligent"" accessibility to the historic centre of Rovereto, which reduces the strong pressure of cars throughout the central area, both in terms of traffic and the employment of parking areas, is one of the more challenging topics of the Piano Urbano della Mobilità The contribution of the study of mobility consists in finding solutions to make the historical centres ""intelligently accessible"", gathering the challenge of keeping services and commercial activities competitive with those organized according to modern paradigms, for example in shopping malls, making them less accessible from the motorized private vehicle without this being a disincentive.In other words, our aim is not only in the concern to ""keep out"" the ""unsustainable"" mobility, which implies a ""passive"" attitude of protection, but instead in the desire to ""bring in"" flows of mobility into conditions of greater sustainability, environmental first, but increasingly also social. This requires an ""active"" positive approach, especially in the plaaces exposed to the risk of commercial decline.The urban realities that succeed in doing this can create the conditions for achieving excellent results not only in terms of reduction of vehicular traffic and consequent negative externalities (atmospheric and acoustic pollution, accidents, land occupation), but also in terms of enhancing the economic and commercial fabric of cities and improving the conditions of security, livability and well-being of the citizens. The process is not free from social conflicts and in many cases raises the opposition of some of the economic activities. For these characteristics it is well calibrated and studied in its operative phase.The participants are invited to make proposals, considerations and suggestions on initiatives, measures and ways to better manage these conflicts, to enhance and highlight the positive aspects linked to the increase in public spaces available to pedestrians and citizens in the city centre, to limit and mitigate any real or perceived kickbacks. Examples of elements that can characterize the approach are: communication and information on data, sharing of good practices adopted in other places, animation initiatives for the city centre, cross-sectoral projects, empowerment of stakeholders in relation to the general objectives of mobility (primarily economic activities and residents), enhancement of services.

rovereto04;Rovereto;challenge;Modal transport in Trentino;How can we implement efficient, effective and universal modal transport in the region of Trentino?;mobility;"Sustainable mobility in the Alpine regions, particularly those close the Brenner corridor, is affected by many challenges and constrains. Future transit of millions of people and increased movement needs of residents into the valleys, will imply new plans of integrated modal transport. The construction works of the new Brenner Base gallery should be ended in 2027. The Brenner Tunnel will be made by two single-track tunnels, that will link Fortezza (in Italy) to Innsbruck (in Austria). The Tunnel will be used not only for goods but also for people. From 2027 onwards, after the Brenner Tunnel will be opened, Trentino will be more accessible for millions of people from Germany and Northern areas; space-time distances will be shortened considerably (only 4 hours will separate the farthest German areas from the Euregio and our main cities). After the Tunnel inauguration, the historical connection between Bolzano, Trento and Rovereto may become a bottleneck, with heavy criticalities. In fact, today, with less than 100 trains per day, Trento area crossed by the trains is full of criticalities and potential conflicts social and legal -noise, vibrations, etc.). In the future, this area could be crossed by 400 trains and transit through city will be unbearable, unless we move entire neighborhoods: that is why the theme of the access routes is not secondary but essential if we want the Tunnel to expand its full potential in the transfer of goods from the road to the rail (today Brenner Pass implements the lowest modal diversion between all the Alpine passes, that is less than 30% of the goods transported by rail, 70% on rubber). Access routes will not solve the Problem because, after accessing our region, German and Northern European citizens, once arrived here, will have to easily move in our valleys. Furthermore, how will our citizens move through the valleys throughout the year? Another import issue in the future will be ""sustainability"", which can not only meant as environmental but also economic (and not only investment but also management). For instance, large infrastructures could drain many financial resources to the management of capillar mobility services for extremely dispersed peripheral zones. Small house agglomerates, villages certainly surely benefit, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, in the extra-urban public transport service on wheels: it won’t be be demonized in favor of the rail service, but certainly assessed carefully weighting the negative and positive externalities. Local public transport “TPL” (both on rail and on wheels) is not effective at 100% on an articulated Alpine territory like Trentino (featured by ""dispersed"" territory and population). Furthermore, in the near future transnational Brenner tunnel and access routes to our region will increase dramatically the people demand of transport. Specific policies governing the correct modal choice mix in terms of public rubber, railways, private rubber shall be created. These policies could include incentives to forms of light mobility and erosion of private mobility: for example, companies with more than 10 employees employ 80.000 peoples, and produce 150.000 travels/day: erosion of a 20% through forms of aid to light mobility (e.g.: bike routes) would imply 30.000 trips; providing 30.000 trips on the public transport means would imply an expense of at least 20-30 M€. Participants will work on solutions for universal transport in the internal areas of Trentino. Is it possible to optimize private means of transport as an alternative to TPL? A few ideas and proposals have been put on the plate: the creation of new local railways (Garda, Cembra Fiemme Fassa, the Dolomites railway along Valsugana,): to what extent will they be feasible? Will be our administration able to make all these local railways, whose cost is about 1,3 and 1,5 billion euros? Will be these railways the engine of sustainable mobility for the valleys for residents throughout the year? Bus passengers in Trentino amount to 47 million/year(intended as travelers on urban buses and suburban coaches, the latest totalling about 24 million out of 47). Passengers carried on the railway are 7,5 millions/year: that is passengers from the extra urban area (about 15 millions) are twice the number of passengers transported by the railway, with an expense that is much less than double for the bus service. Likewise, rail passengers per day, 22.000, is about half of the 45.000 passengers per days that use extra-urban buses. An integrated mobility policy should be based on the following three pillars: 1) railway mobility: for connections with large transport networks with the strengthening of the connecting stations of Trento and Rovereto; 2) public mobility “on wheels"": for secondary connections; 3) private mobility “on wheels"": for the last mile (plan for home-work movements, fostering bike use, carpool and car sharing).

It's to encourage people with public transport,reducing pollution The strength of our project is to create a gamification not based on cash prizes, but on free parking in the city center by counting the minutes spent during the stop. The challenge we faced was to think of a way to reduce the overcrowding of parking lots near the historic center, so as to reduce air pollution and noise. Analyzing the data at our disposal we are able to notice that the biggest problem resides in the early hours of the morning, which indicates that the users most involved are the workers or those who go in this time frame in Rovereto.     Our proposal was to decentralize existing car parks, not eliminating those already present in the historic center, but creating areas, on the outskirts of the city, used for parking. The further challenge is to encourage citizens to use the sustainable mobility services provided by the Municipality. Initially we studied the layout of the parking lots in the historic center and it was decided to modify the free-parking areas in paid areas. Furthermore, it has been decided to create some parking areas in the suburbs and to promote their use by means of a special subscription for the cost of € 90 and € 50, respectively, for all the citizens of the province and the workers who work in the city. The mechanism is simple: the user wishing to enter the parking area picks up a ticket from the service kiosk. Upon exit, the payment device issues a second ticket and if the user is in possession of the subscription he will not have to pay the requested amount, equal to € 1.70 per day. This last ticket shows a code that the user can enter in a special mobile application to get some facilitation. Our application allows: Accumulate minutes that can be used in city center parking lots. This collection of minutes is only possible if the previously described parking areas are used; Pay a parking ticket in the city center, which involves the loss of minutes; View project partnerships.

At present, students represent 70 % of public transport users, while workers do not use it often. This implies they are using their own private transportation, which has a huge impact on the environment like global warming, depletion of ozone, noise and water pollution. Moreover, problems related to human health. With this challenge, we want to promote the usage of public transport, so that we can reduce these impacts. Our solution to these problems is "" MOBILITree"", which is an app that helps you to plant trees by giving you points whenever you use public transport. To encourage the use of public transport, we plan to employ negative compelling advertisements about the harmful effects of private transport through posters on companies notice boards and community gatherings, where workers spend most of their time. Moreover, we discourage private transport by increasing the parking charge and making parking locations away from the city.

Specific policies governing the correct modal choice mix in terms of public rubber, railways, private rubber shall be created. 33pool is a web app that allows workers to share their travel with others. Trentino has a lot of small companies so we believe the carpooling solution should not be promoted by a single company. Our solution organize travels by clusters of destinations. Moreover, the key point of the app is to promote intermodal travels. Both the driver and the passenger will gain points based on how often they travel and if they will arrive on the final destination by a public means of transportation. This points can be converted in park or bus tickets and for lower the car property tax. The travels will be clustered in week schedules so the commitment is lasting longer and its easier to create a habit.

The problems we have identified are due to: Half-empty buses for about half of the rides Difficulty in forecasting peripheral traffic flows, commuters move on average with 1.2 people per car, consequently transport is very inefficient Traffic peaks of private cars in the major centers of Lavis, Trento and Rovereto The solution is Buscar, which can approach the usual Car Pooling apps and hitchhiking, but we want to overcome the difficulties of these solutions: I trust who gives me a ride? Are the departure and arrival points of the journey guaranteed? How can I use the service without an app? How to make it cheap and accessible? BusCar encompasses the reliability of the journey, a capillary and physical information thanks to the blue signs placed in the strategic points of the countries, this makes accessible, visible and regulate the practice of hitchhiking. It also generates a cohesion of countries thanks to the socialization typical of group travel, a social development and a rationalization of transport that we think can reduce the flow of private cars by 5% per year. The reduction of environmental impact, of the citizens' kilometers, of the costs for the community is important, as can a car for a family unit. Further details in the slide.

Segregation of paper, PET and aluminum cans is limited. Waste management has been a burning issue in Šabac for years. The amount of waste increases in tons each month and the designated landfill is being filled out faster than predicted. On the other hand, awareness in the city and nearby villages about recycling and issues concerning waste management is on a low level.

Ultimate Cell optimizes combustion by producing and dosing a precise amount of hydrogen and mixing it with the air-fuel mixture, to achieve a more complete combustion, due to small precise amounts of hydrogen gas acting as a catalyst in the combustion process, thanks to hydrogen's much faster combustion speed (burn rate/ flame speed), when compared with that of conventional fossil fuels. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/ultimate-cell-harmful-vehicle-emissions-reducing-device;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/human-behaviour/how-to-improve-air-quality-trough-smart-technologies-and-human-behavior

Circular economy refers to an economy that can reduce waste and generate growth in sustainable ways. It is an important in solving the climate change problem. Suzhou can adopt a circular economy approach in order to avoid short-sighted design, conspicuous consumption, and inefficient waste handling. Suzhou should invest resources in re-cycling, re-using, re-inventing: let’s imagine ways to extend the lifecycle of everyday objects and to re-use energy in an upcycling approach connected to sustainable consumption and production patterns. Both individual and collective action is needed. For example: More than two billion tons of construction and demolition waste is generated in China annually, while the extraction of raw materials keeps depleting natural resources. Can we try to close the loop by reducing, re-using, recycling correction materials? ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/circular-economy/circular-economy;

Human behaviour is one major problem in generating waste and climate change. To solve climate change human behaviour needs to be changed. Climate change is occurring rapidly, it is harmful and human caused, because citizen behaviour is largely responsible for current trends in global warming. We can fight misinformation and common misconceptions about climate change, explain air pollution exposure impact and extreme wealther-related disasters, engage citizens and convince them it is time to act on one of the most pressing issues of our time. For example: How can we use buildings more efficiently, to reduce energy and water consumption? Buildings account for around one-third of the energy use and greenhouse gases emissions in China, and a sizeable amount of this is wasted by overheating spaces regulated by poor control systems, lighting empty rooms etc. Similarly, we overuse drinkable water, which in part goes literally flushed down the toilets.

Helping companies act sustainably We develop an interactive and motivational app that helps companies and their employees succeed in reaching their sustainability goals. At the same time, saving costs, building a responsible brand and increasing employee engagement. Companies are defined by their employees and the actions they do. For many companies, it is difficult to: start implementing green changes, to engage all employees in this process, to act fast and make a profit from it. Many companies have their own sustainability strategies on an institutional level (hierarchical management), which means that even though a company has 1500 employees the creativity in order to reach sustainability is restricted to 5-20 people whose main focus is centered around a 5 or 10-year strategy. Hence, the small steps in the daily working environments toward a greener business are neglected. By providing small daily challenges as a gamification for every employee, the company will reach it´s strategies faster throughout every level of the company. There is an international Green Office certificate that companies can attain when meeting all the sustainability standards, but it focuses more on the general aspects and doesn’t focus on the behaviour of employees. It is also possible for companies to measure their carbon footprint but often the contribution of every employee for the company's footprint is being underestimated. We develop an interactive and motivational app that helps companies and their employees succeed in reaching their sustainability goals & obtaining the Green Office certificate. By engaging employees through gamification and providing small tasks each day, we help them form sustainable behavior habits and split this big challenge into small doable steps. Companies will cut down costs, save resources and obtain a greener image.In addition, teamwork, communication, and productivity will be improved through our fun gamified team challenges. We tailor the challenges according to company’s needs taking into account whether it involves office work, factory work etc. As every company wants to cut down their costs, why not to do that while saving resources, increasing employee engagement and building a greener image? ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/compact;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/human-behaviour/how-to-influence-people-and-reach-to-decision-makers

trondheim01;Trondheim;challenge;Circular Campus at NTNU;How can we reduce the carbon footprint of university operations by measures for circular economy?;circular-economy;"NTNU has the environmental ambition to reduce its carbon footprint from all categories. Purchases of goods and service other than energy use and transportation adds up to 45% of NTNU’s total carbon footprint. We need more concrete solutions to reduce the impact from this category! NTNU – the Norwegian University of Science and Technology is the largest university in Norway, with 40,000 students, 7000 employees and an annual turnover of 9 billion NOK. It is currently divided into four separate campuses, of which two are located in Gjøvik and Ålesund. In Trondheim, the social sciences and humanities at Dragvoll are soon moving closer to the city centre, together with the other parts of the university campus at Gløshaugen, Kalvskinnet and Øya. This will be a large operation that puts its mark on the city development of Trondheim in the years to come. NTNU have four strategic research areas: Oceans, Health, Energy and Sustainability. NTNU Sustainability consists of several core partners from research environments that excel within the field of environmental sustainability. This include centres such as Zero Emission Neighbourhoods in Smart Cities (ZEN), Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD), Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies (CenSES) and various departments with relevant activity across NTNU. “Transition towards a circular economy and sustainable production and consumption systems” is one of the four focus areas of NTNU Sustainability.  NTNU and Trondheim Municipality has had close cooperation throughout the years. This partnership was recently lifted to a strategic level and manifested in the University City agreement TRD 3.0. In July 2018, the +CityxChange proposal under the “Smart Cities and Communities” call of the EU Horizon2020 programme got positive signal from the European Commission.  This consortium was led by NTNU, with Trondheim as one of the two lighthouse cities. ""NTNU - Knowledge for a Better World"" NTNU has set high environmental ambition and aims to be the frontrunner who make use of knowledge from their research activities in its own practice to become an environmentally-friendly organisation. In Climathon Trondheim 2018, an unique partnership within NTNU is established, with representatives from NTNU Sustainability, NTNU’s Properties and Operation Dept. and Engage, Centre for Engaged Education through Entrepreneurship. The innovation process and its results shall expectedly be of interest for Trondheim Municipality and many more. NTNU’s carbon footprint for 2017 was almost 100,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent. About 55% of this comes from energy use and transportation. For these categories there are several ongoing initiatives for reducing the climate impact. Here is an overview of NTNU's carbon footprint. The remaining 45% is associated with NTNUs use of a myriad of different types of products and services. This spans from laboratory equipment to furnitures, IT-equipment, advisory services, waste treatment services etc. Here is a detailed breakdown of NTNU's carbon footprint. We need more efforts addressing this 45%-category of “other goods and services” and believe that concepts and principals within “circular economy” could be useful. The term “circular economy” has become a popular buzzword in the environment scene the last few years. Lacking a unified and agreed-upon definition, the term is usually associated with facilitating sharing of resources, re-use and recycling to achieve constant level of function with lower total resource use. We’d like to invite students, researchers, citizens and entrepreneurs to join Climathon Trondheim 2018 and co-develop innovative strategies, tools, products, services or other initiatives that contribute to reduce carbon footprint from this challenging category.

We offer NTNU a long lasting partnership which includes maintenance and upgrade of the product during the whole demand period, and retrieve the product at the end. This will push us into providing a product with the longest life cycle possible since we want to minimize our costs. On the other hand, we free the costumer of worrying about how long the product will last and how many times it will break down since they are paying for the service and we take full responsibility in case of a malfunction. Our motivation to do this is to gain the costumer for the whole demand period which would mean having a stable income for such a long time without necessarily having extra investments. At the retrieval stage of the product, we as a service provider, can actually reuse the same product by setting up further customer partnerships. We are reducing production, reusing products as well as recycling them when necessary. In this way, the resource use is optimized and we contribute to a decrease in CO2 emissions which is NTNU's crucial aim in its the action plan against climate change. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/service-based-company;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/circular-economy/circular-campus

turin01;Turin;challenge;Get the city ready to deal with extreme weather events;How do we empower the city to manage hydric resources and prevent waste and environmental damage? ;extreme-weather;"Reduced availability of water resources, increased erosion processes and flood risk are currently significant problems: let's solve them together Italy is at the center of an area considered as an ""hot spot"" of climate change that is one of the most sensitive areas and predictably subjected to the consequences of ""climate change"" because of increase in temperatures and extreme weather events and because the modification of precipitation regimes (decrease in frequency together with the increase in intensity), which cause rapidly evolving alluvial phenomena (commonly referred to as ""flash flood""), involving the urban environment and often triggering phenomena of disruption of mountainsides. In urban areas, the high exposure to risks deriving from climate change is also attributed to the concentration of people and economic assets, and the effects are more noticeable due to the combination of the various factors, such as increase in temperature and variation in the rainfall. Moreover, access to water risks becoming increasingly difficult to guarantee, also due to climate change, especially in urban areas. Despite the increasingly evident situation, this fundamental resource is still being wasted. For example, in Italy in 2015, 38% of the water injected into the distribution networks was lost, with total losses that could meet the annual demand of 10 million people. in addition to infrastructural requalification, it is necessary to reduce the consumption of drinking water: Italy, with 241 litres per inhabitant per year, ranks first in Europe for per capita consumption, and only a small part of this share is recovered and reused. About the massive uses that are made at the agricultural and industrial level the percentages of use of water resources are globally unequivocal: agriculture 60%, industry and commercial users 30%, drinking water 10%. In Piedmont Region, the ARPA data show that it is now evident that global warming has caused effects on temperatures and changes in the precipitation regime, both on temporal variability and extreme events, and on long-term trends. The maximum temperatures have risen by almost 2° C in 60 years, more markedly in mountain areas and, in the last 10-15 years, record years are still recorded with high temperatures emphasized by heat waves of anomalous summer heat of particular intensity and mild winters.   Below you will find some examples of possible solutions. For more information please see documents in download section. MONITORING AND PREVENTION Develop integrative monitoring systems in order to observe the territory at a more detailed scale, also through the use of the IoT; Define tools for the identification and management of the ""relevant planning areas"" for the purpose of climate adaptation, also by assessing the degrees of vulnerability (vulnerability assessment) and the related priorities of action (climate change risk assessment); Define preventive and supplementary measures and alert measures to help mitigate the effects of extreme events; Develop new forms of communication in emergency, also through APP and social media; Develop new methods of participatory management of public spaces; Propose structured interventions both on the urban scale and on the building Develop urban planning tools and measures aimed at defining methodologies, techniques and intervention criteria for the construction, recovery, transformation, planning of green spaces and public spaces, aimed at improving the quality of urban environments in relation to climate changes. SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES Promote a trans-disciplinary and multisectoral approach in the management of the resource by integrating the scientific, technological, socio-economic, environmental and health aspects; Plan the sustainable use of water resources based on community needs, national development strategies and possible scenarios of climate change; Prepare, evaluate and implement economically and socially sustainable projects and programs on the basis of broad public participation; Identify, implement and strengthen appropriate socio-institutional, regulatory and financial mechanisms to ensure that water policies and their implementation are a focal point for social progress and economic growth. We can also intervene through good practices that encourage: ""Tap"" water consumption; Monitoring of consumption, also with the help of the new Internet of Things technologies; Optimization of consumption, for example by reducing the ""water footprint""; water reuse.

This game for kids and their parents shows the health, environmental and social impact of mosquitos and how to avoid behaviour and habits that create environments that benefit and spread mosquitos. An interactive game for kids on how to combat tiger mosquitos 80% of all tiger mosquitos are found in private spheres. This game for kids and their parents shows the health, environmental and social impact of mosquitos and how to avoid behaviour and habits that create environments that benefit and spread mosquitos. Due to climate change and the increased temperature in many parts of the globe, insects such as the Asian tiger mosquito are exploding in population throughout Spain and the Mediterranean region. Since their arrival in 2005, these mosquitos are responsible for spreading potentially fatal viruses such as dengue, zika and chikungunya, as already seen in Italy and France. Even the bites of the tiger mosquito are considered more painful than their native Spanish counterparts. Research shows the mosquitos spread, reproduce and thrive in locations with high degree of human activity, particularly in the private sphere, such as homes and gardens. The insects find ponds and pools or even trash, such as empty containers of yoghurts or empty plastic bottles that have collected stagnant water where they lay eggs that lie dormant during winter before hatching with the flies in spring. Scientists in Valencia have started to conduct tests aiming to reduce the mosquito population through sterilization programs. To control the wide-spread and reproduction of the mosquitos is a good start. However, it is equally important to focus on human behavior and daily practices that are, directly or indirectly, contributing to desirable environments for well-being and wide-spread of mosquitos. Through changed human behavior we can reduce health and environmental risks. The project requires collaboration with the Valencia municipality and other governmental bodies on local and regional levels in order to deliver an efficient product for the schools of the city. Representatives of the city have already shown interest in the project and have provided great encouragement to proceed with the development of the game. Hence, it is pivotal that this collaboration does not end after it’s first cycle, but becomes a recurrent element at schools, in order to ensure positive and long-lasting results through the reduction of the tiger mosquito population.   Since 80% of all tiger mosquitos are found in private spheres, e.g. homes and gardens, it is pivotal to identify, analyze and find solutions to any pattern that contributes to the wide-spread of the mosquitos. This project, a didactic and interactive game for children between the age of 8 and 10, will present the health, environmental and social impact of the growing population of tiger mosquitos. It will also present where and how the mosquitos thrive, as well as provide tips and recommendations on how to avoid behaviors and habits that create environments that benefit and spread mosquitos. The game will be used during class at schools where special pedagogues, together with teachers, facilitate the learning process through playful and educational methodologies. The parents of the children will also be involved since parts of the game will be conducted at home, as homework. By engaging parents (and adults) in this process we can increase the awareness of crucial groups in the society. By integrating the concept of nudging - positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the actions of groups and individuals, we will contribute to short-term as well as long-term behavioral changes. This project aims also to create synergies and strengthen existing initiatives, such as the app, Mosquito Alert.. The app uses participation of the public as a mean for scientists to review photos of mosquitos and detect breeding sites. Our game will refer to this app as a source of information and will encourage parents and children to use it and send their own photos. The app has already an element of gamification where the user receives points for each sent photo. This project will through a cooperation with the app developers and owners provide further gamification methods and offer rewards, such as tickets to cultural events, to increase the number of users and develop a bridge between the game and the app, with particular focus on younger users. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/en-busca-del-mosquito-perdido-un-juego-didactico-contra-el-mosquito-tigre-looking-for-the-lost-mosquito-a-didactic-game-against-the-tiger-mosquito;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/extreme-weather/fighting-the-tiger-mosquito-in-valencia-city-its-presence-is-the-indisputable-consequence-of-climate-change

Urban and social changes in Valletta over the past few decades, especially in the last few years, have brought to the surface a number of issues that are directly affecting the liveability factor in Valletta. Taking into consideration the definition of what a liveable city should be and the strategy for the City of Valletta as being the Unesco Heritage Capital City, Gentrification continues to be a hot topic. While much of the discussion focuses on homogenization and property values, environmental and health effects are commonly overlooked.

Segway-to-Go In order to reduce the traffic congestion in Valletta, a fleet of Segways is provided within the city for public use, by using the car-sharing concept with Segways. The city of Valletta is suffering from daily traffic congestions due to the high number of cars in the very limited space that is shared by both vehicles and pedestrians. This does not only affect the environment of the city and its surrounding, but also affects the liveability of the capital in a negative way. The proposed solution aims to reduce the use of cars within the city walls by simultaneously offering a fast, green alternative that can even improve the mobility in Valletta. The concept of vehicle-sharing has been in use for a while in many cities around the world. Many cities also offer city-bikes to be borrowed at one station and given bacl at another. However, while both aim to reduce the overall number of vehicles on the road, they can not pose an efficient solution in the case of Valletta, as in the former case, there is already an aim to ban private-owned cars from the city and in the latter, due to the city's geographical position the weather in summer months can be very unpleasant, and there are many steep roads which make the use of bikes difficult, especially for the significant number of residents who are limited in their mobility. Segway-to-Go offers a solution to all of these obstacles. While the main station is located close to the park-and-right facility of Valletta, our Segways can be used all around the city. A mobile-app allows users to find the closest Segway, book it, and activate it with their phones. By Segway, users can get very fast from one place to another, whether it is to go to the supermarket, to get from one office to the other, or just simply make your way to your workplace in the heart of Valletta. Segways do not require any major physical activity and is therefore an overall solution for tourists as well as residents with various mobility situations. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/segway-to-go;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/air-pollution/bridging-liveability-make-valletta-a-liveable-city

Do NO Waste!;How to improve waste to resource pathway for Varaždin city and the citizens?;waste-management;"The city of Varaždin wants to improve waste separation to increase volumes of resource circulation through local economy; to improve the management of waste textiles, plastics and other materials in Varaždin so they keep on circulating efficiently and be a resource for the city and the citizens. The Waste Management Plan for the Republic of Croatia 2017 - 2022 prescribes the national waste management objectives to be achieved by 2022 compared to 2015, which are also the waste management objectives of the City of Varaždin. It is necessary to separately collect 60% of municipal waste (paper, glass, plastic, metal, textile). The existing waste management system in the area of the City of Varaždin can be assessed as partially satisfactory with the need for upgrading to increase the efficiency of separation of recyclable waste. Namely, the separation of specific components from municipal waste is still insufficient, which makes the quality of waste management unsatisfactory, inconsistent and economically ineffective. The efficiency of separate waste collection needs to be improved by continuous education and engagement of citizens. The amount of waste textile collected separately or separated from municipal waste is relatively small. The system of waste textile management as a special category of waste did not come to life. In the composition of solid municipal waste in the Republic of Croatia waste textiles occupy 3.7%, while waste textiles in the MSW in the City of Varaždin textile occupies 5.1 %. During 2017 in the City of Varaždin, approximately 5 tons of waste textile and footwear was received in the recycling yard Motičnjak. We want innovative ideas on how to use that resource! And how to separately collect the other types of waste or to avoid generating waste in the first place by having an innovative, smart and fun way of exchanging unwanted/used items or repairing them – finding a new useful purpose. The challenge for the city of Varaždin is to improve the waste separation and thus to increase the quantities of resources that circulate through local (not only) economy i.e. to improve the management of waste materials in Varaždin so they keep on circulating efficiently and be a resource for the city and the citizens. We see several sub-challenges here: A solution for re-use of waste textiles: how to re-use? How to do in a more efficient and smart way the exchange of unwanted items – what is a waste for some people is a new thing or useful for the others. How to establish a platform in the city for items exchange and repair i.e. – repair garage? Application? Else? How to engage more citizens into a separation of waste materials – looking for a smart-phone application to direct citizens to the closest collection point for specific types of waste. The App should at the same time serve as a waste-materials tracker to enable the city to monitor the types and amounts of separated waste materials thus to better plan recycling and further operation of the city sorting plant. Ideally, the collection points should offer further separation of certain types of plastics i.e. enable better sorting so the sorting plant and further recycling paths would get cleaner inputs/resources.

Our app will show a map of our network's cafes and restaurants, who will have to install a purifier, refill tourists' water bottles and sell our branded ones. Tourists will discover it thanks to an attractive advertising in few hotspots of the city. Venice hosts 12 million tourists every year: it’s one of the most visited city in the world and the mean period of the stay is two days. Venice is a city of art and culture and most of the tourists wolks around the ancient city center. Due to the large number of visitors, a significant part of the garbage production is to be ascribed to tourists. Also, i’ts important to underline that garbage collection in Venice is very expensive, due to the logistic issues: the collection, in fact, is made by boats and require about 500 workers every day just for the city center. Suppose every tourist drinks 1 plastic bottles per day: then it’s needed a bin as big as San Marco’s bell tower to contain them for one year (12 million m3/year; 600 million tons/year). The aim of this project is to create a network of cafes and restaurants that would help reduce the number of plastic bottles in Venice. We will ask our network’s shopkeepers: to install a purifier and to refill tourists’ water bottles at a convenient cost (0.20 €); to sell our branded steel water bottle. An app will be developed, in which tourists can find an interactive map of our network’s shopkeepers with a few information about them. We will also add a layer to visualize the location of the already existing water fountains and some infographics about the way recycling in Venice works; these last information and map are already available but by adding them in our app those would be more visible. In a free training course, we will explain to shopkeepers what the advantages of being part of our network are. We would like to show them both the economic and practical benefits for themselves (reduced costs, more space, installing a purifier is already common and easy to do) and the environmental effects that reducing plastic could have on their beloved city. Tourists will discover the app in a few very visited hotspots (e.g. train station, airport) thank to an attractive advertising, such as an art installation, near which will be shown a QR code. To do this, we will need a permission from the local administration and a collaboration with local artists or local visual art students; this could be an opportunity to make partnerships that would give us more credibility.

How can more data on hot and cool places in the city be provided? How can we close data gaps on waste heat sources that often remain unused and further heat up the city? Over the last few decades the number of annual heat days with temperatures above 30 °C has risen significantly in Vienna. In 2015, an all-time record of 42 heat days was registered. Due to this development the Urban Heat Islands (UHI) phenomenon - significantly higher temperatures in densely built-up areas - is becoming more frequent. In which places in the city do you feel comfortable/uncomfortable in summer? Residents of Vienna should get the opportunity to report perceived hot and cold places in the city so that this information can be used for climate-friendly city planning. What can be done to improve the situation about overheated places in the city and to make good use of them? How can places be made visible that provide cooling? Residents should receive information about how to escape the heat. Cool places should be linked to possible activities in these places. Where are waste heat sources in Vienna that affect the micro climate? How can we make use of this ""hot air""?

vienna02;Vienna;challenge;Shared mobility;How can sharing of (private) means of transport be promoted to reduce traffic in the city?;mobility;"Growing cities like Vienna face increasing traffic density. New mobility concepts can contribute to avoiding additional and reducing existing emissions from transport. How can we make use of technological progress and digitalisation to optimise transportation in the city of the future? There are many different modes of transport available in Vienna and several new concepts are already in place (well established bike and car sharing, bike highways, electric buses, etc.). Nevertheless, there is still much potential for innovative mobility solutions - especially when it comes to private means of transport. Many privately owned cars, bikes, etc. are not in use during most of the day. Also, occupancy rates of publicly available services like bike sharing, charging stations for electric vehicles, etc. could be raised. As new forms of mobility and changes in daily routines take their time, the question comes up: How can digital solutions increase acceptance of sharing models and other new forms of mobility? How can behavioural changes be incentivised and inhibition thresholds be lowered? What can be done to promote the shared use of cars, motorcycles, bicycles, etc. to reduce traffic in the city? Sub-questions: How could privately owned cars, motorcycles, (e-)bikes, parking space, charging stations for electric vehicles, etc. be made available for shared public use?

How can these data be used to motivate sustainable behaviour? How can citizens actively contribute to energy efficiency? The aim of Aspern Smart City Research (ASCR) is to optimise urban energy production and consumption in such a way that the users of smart buildings and citizens of smart cities in general can participate in the future of urban energy. What makes ASCR unique is that a network operator, energy supplier and technology company as well as property developers, technical manufacturers, administrators and residents all collaborate in this research project. The Vienna-based venture is one of the most innovative and sustainable energy efficiency showcase projects in the world. Research at ASCR focuses on complex connections, rather than individual elements, using real data from various domains such as smart metering, smart buildings, weather data, home automation, etc. In cooperation with selected households and businesses new smart solutions are developed and testet before they ultimately will be applied on a large scale and to entire cities. Some of the research questions at ASCR - and the lead questions for this climathon challenge - are: How can residents of smart buildings be motivated (""nudged"") to actually use the available data and actively participate in Vienna's Smart City process? Which feedback to energy consumers would be suitable to reward them for energy savings? How can consumer participation be sustained?  Solutions should focus on these sub-questions:  Which additional data could be used to increase consumer participation? ASCR already uses data from smart metering, smart buildings, weather data, home automation, etc. Teams should elaborate how additional data (e.g. from open data platforms) could contribute to the attractiveness of smart solutions. How should solutions be designed to fit a majority of the population? Taking into account design thinking methods, teams should develop solutions that address different target groups (customer segments, regardless of their personal interests, educational background, age, etc.) with a single user interface. How can data be presented to spark and sustain customers' interest? The solution should guarantee long-term attention by customers. By providing services with regard to energy supply, home automation, etc. additional value can be generated. How can sustainble energy behaviour be promoted? The users should be given the opportunity to understand and explore the interconnection of individual behaviour and environmental impacts.  This challenge is hosted by Aspern Smart City Research (ASCR). Depending on the degree of maturity and successful achievement of the solutions, a further cooperation and a further pursuit of a presented solution is possible.

vienna04;Vienna;challenge;Urban rain water management;What can be done to allow a maximum of rainwater in cities to evaporate decentrally?;water-management;Today most rainwater from city streets is fed into the sewer system to protect trees and ground water from road salt and other contaminants. How can more of this water be brought to evaporation and remain in the natural water cycle? Because rainwater from city streets is often charged with road salt (in winter) and other contaminants, it is mostly fed into the sewer system. Therefore, - and with heavy rainfalls becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change - large public investments are needed to maintain adequate capacities of the sewer system. On the other hand city trees often lack water during hot and dry summer periods. Retention and evaporation of rainwater could benefit city trees and reduce the urban heat effect, thereby contributing to climate change adaptation. Solutions to these conflicting targets should focus on: Improving growing conditions for trees on streets and in the city in general Avoiding saline intrusion into the groundwater (in winter) Retention of rainwater in case of havy rainfalls to reduce the load on the sewer systems Increasing evaporation of surface water to reduce urban heat effects Innovative systems for the separation of winter and summer surface water (constructional, technical, with the help of IT solutions, etc.)  This challenge is hosted by the City of Vienna, Environmental Protection Department (MA 22).

vienna05;Vienna;challenge;Decentralised energy systems;How can energy demand be flexibly managed and decentral resources be used more efficiently?;energy;Vienna's power system is increasingly influenced by distributed renewable energy resources. How can new business models and technologies contribute to the management of energy use to better meet this fluctuating power supply? In decentralised energy systems electrical generation and storage is performed by a variety of small, grid-connected devices referred to as distributed energy resources (DER). These are located close to the load they serve and typically use renewable energy sources. DER can be operated by either commercial providers (e.g. small hydro or wind power plants) or private households and businesses that feed surplus energy from their local photovoltaic or geothermal system etc. to the public grid. So far, this form of energy production by consumers (“prosuming”) still is at an early development stage and the required legal framework as well as technical prerequisites like smart meters are only gradually being rolled-out. Nonetheless, growing consumer interest and the need for decarbonisation/diversification of the energy system are strong drivers that will transform the energy system and pose a challenge to transmission system operators (typically public monopolies). In 2025, up to 20 % of electricity customers could be “prosumers”. This will boost the need for matching the increasingly volatile energy supply with current demand patterns. How can individual energy demand in cities be flexibly adjusted to fluctuating energy production and grid load from renewable sources, so that overall energy efficiency and carbon intensity can be optimised? Which new business models and innovative technologies could be provided and/or used by small businesses, private service providers, municipal grid operators, and citizens to flexibly consume energy in times of vast supply or provide energy in case of high demand? The Climathon teams should work out probable consequences businesses and grid operators in the city will face in the context of these developments and put together suggestions on how to respond by technical, organisational and/or business adjustments. This could be an elaborated and pre-formulated concept or the development of a prototype (visualisation, mock-up, click-dummy, etc.). Solutions should focus on: Incentive systems to influence consumer behaviour (e.g. by dynamic price setting, control signals, sharing models, etc.) Smart distribution systems for the carbon-efficient management of energy sypply and demand Smart feed-in and energy trading systems for prosumers Real-time management systems for energy demand taking into account current feed-in volumes  This challenge is hosted by MunichRe and ERGO.

Excess energy is produced as a side product and is not used and often dumped. We want to use this excess energy and want to store this energy in our storage units to provide it cheaply to users in a smaller unit. Our approach is to buy it, when it's at its cheapest (in least demand) and sell it when it is at its highest demand, which is in the morning and evening for a profit margin.

Prevention of urban salt loaded rainwater and desalinization meth Our solution focus are on reducing the volume of rainwater which hits the salt infested pavement, substitute the used salts and finding feasible solutions for separating salts from loaded rainwater. The rainwater from roads of city of Vienna is frequently loaded with salt in winter for de-icing. During the periods of heavy rains, which would come more and more often due to the climate change, the sewer system is overloaded. The challange here was to come up with the solution that would help to reduce the volume of the rainwater in streets of Vienna. Another challenge was to find alternatives for de-icing the roads, because of salt's negative impacts on the environment. In the case if salt alternatives will not prove to be sufficient, we were trying to have a look at the ways how to separate the loaded and unloaded water. Our solution focuses on 3 challenges. The first one - the reduction of the volume of street runoff - is to use as much environmentally friendly water management tools as possible. This can be done by integration of retention, evaporation, infiltration, green and blue infrastructure elements in forms of e.g. permeable pavements, semi-permeable parking lots, blue roofs, watersqueres, improvement of the drainage system. The solution for the second challange are the alternatives for the technical salt. These includes more traditional ones such as calcium magnesium acetate, but also the more innovative ones such as beet juice or coffee grounds. In case these salt alternatives will prove to be not sufficient, or too financially demanding, we come up with technical solutions of the salt separation from loaded water. Electrolysis sensors from the wastewater treatment plant can sense and divert loaded water to storage tanks. This water can then be evaporated by (a) heating while underground or (b) by pumping the water to blue roof ponds that double as salt pans. In the latter which takes place in summer, the evaporation also cools the building to reduce urban heat island effect, and the salt is recovered for reuse. This combines obviously short term solutions, and long term solutions with co-benefits that create a greener city. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/prevention-of-urban-salt-loaded-rainwater-and-desalinization-methods;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/water-management/urban-rain-water-management

vienna010;Vienna;solution;Decentralised energy-pooling;Extended tenant electricity model;energy;"with participation on energy markets Extended tenant electricity model with participation on energy markets The rapid growth of renewable energy systems, opens up a lot of new challenge for the power grid. Because of the time difference between production and demand, the grid is going to its edges. Every single ""WATT"" that is produced has to be consumed at the same time. Renewable energies are fluctuating so the consumer now has to follow new rules of future energy systems. One solution could be the regulation of the consumption of everybody. But will people never turn off the TV when the sun isn't shining. Our solution is to give the urban community the opportunity to participate on the global warming challenge. We offer for every Consumer a technology package with PV integrated storage systems for power and heat-solutions. People don't have to change their habits strictly, but they get encouraged to shift their energy consumption to sun-hours by earning ""green mobility points"". Those can be consumed for local sustainable mobility projects in their urban area, like e-scooter, e-car-sharing, public transportation and so on. We pool our green battery systems and heat pumps into a virtual power plant. Thus provides balancing services for the power grid. With our concept, we will become an enabler for growing renewable decentralised energy systems without interrupt the power grid. The funding of such energy systems is based on a crowdfunding model on the one hand and urban building enterprises on the other hand.

vilnius01;Vilnius;challenge;Improving mobility solutions in Vilnius city;How can we improve our daily travels within Vilnius?;mobility;Many have seen that Vilnius is struggling with an ever-growing number of personal vehicles. This results in delayed journeys, air and even sound pollution. Join us for a global #Climathon movement, solve the challenge, travel across Vilnius and help us find more efficient and green ways to commute. The rapid economic development since Lithuania has become a part of the European Union has resulted in an average increase in salaries of by 39% in the year 2007-2017 - the best result across OECD members. Many citizens could afford various consumer products for the first time in their lives that were widely used in the West - including a personal vehicle. The current statistics published by Vilnius city authorities say that currently, the city has 0.87 vehicles for every 18-60-year-old citizen. Even worse, it is expected that there will be 1 vehicle per capita by the year 2021. There is no surprise that the municipality struggles to deal with such a growth of personal vehicles as most infrastructural projects take longer time and are very expensive. This results in traffic jams and longer, less efficient journeys as well as both air and noise pollution.

Over 90% of all shopping bags sold in our retail chain are plastic. In some sections like bread, fresh meat and fish we offer an alternative - paper bags or wrapping paper. Our company reduces the consumption of plastic bags and its potential negative impact on the environment by various means. For example, our IKI plastic bags are partly made from our own recycled plastic. To our customers, we offer reusable bags and we see that they are becoming more and more popular. The biggest problem we see is with the use of small plastic bags used to put goods like fruits and vegetables, sweets, etc.  During the last 10 years, customers became so much attached to them that they use around 150 millions small plastic bags each year. Simple paper bags is not the solution due to its size – some people want to put 2 kg of apples or 5 kg of potatoes and it cost a lot to the company.

wellington01;Wellington;challenge;Air Transport Emissions;How Can We Reduce Our Air Transport Emissions?;;"New Zealand’s economy depends on aviation. Whether we are exporting high-value products to the world, or welcoming tourists to our shores, we rely on airlines to serve us. How Can We Reduce Our Air Transport Emissions? - Climathon NZ New Zealand does not have a high speed rail network, and only has a rail commuter network in Auckland and Wellington, that can reduce the need for domestic aviation. For many rapid routes air travel is the only viable transport option between the two islands. The majority of passenger seats (85%) are operated by two carriers; Air New Zealand and Jetstar.Add paragraph text here. Our air transport accounts for around 3500 ktonnes of emitted CO2 per year; around 1000 ktonnes for Domestic and 2500 for International travel. Our passenger movements have seen strong growth, a trend predicted to continue into the future that leads to a worrying growth in emissions from this sector. New Zealand has committed to reducing its GHG emissions. But our economy would suffer if a climate tax meant that tourists couldn’t afford to fly here. International tourism brought $12 Bn into the economy last year. We rely on it. New Zealand is recognised for its pro-active stance towards reducing aviation and airport operation emissions. New Zealand’s air navigation service provider (Airways) is globally known for working proactively with airlines to increase flight efficiency and safety. Locally the Ministry of Transport are implementing an action plan to reduce emissions in this sector that you can read here. This Ministry initiative is strongly supported by Wellington Airport with their own reduction plan being put in place. New Zealand has an important role to play in developing clean aviation technologies, such as hybrid electric aircraft. This research programme is part of our 30-year programme of leading high-temperature superconducting work. The New Zealand team are working on key aspects of the high-torque, high-speed machines needed to make electric aviation a reality. Their international partners include Lockheed, Boeing, and NASA. There are opportunities for NZ companies to produce specialised, high-value components for the hybrid electric supply chain, earn export revenue, and contribute to solving this pressing global problem. NZ can benefit economically from addressing a major global greenhouse gas challenge. ";https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/how-can-we-reduce-our-air-transport-emissions;
wellington02;Wellington;challenge;Waste-free future;How to move towards a waste-free future with a circular economy?;;We are currently in a linear economy where we take resources from nature to make things, use them for a short time, before disposing of them to landfill. There Is A Better Alternative To 'Take, Make and Dispose' - Climathon NZ New Zealand has a waste problem and we need to make some big changes now for the future of our environment. As a country we are one of the highest producers of urban waste in the developed world, with each of us sending around 730kg to landfill per year. We need to stop using resources once and throwing them away, it’s not doing our environment any favours and it doesn’t make sense for our economy either. We are currently in a linear economy where we take resources from nature to make things, use them for a short time, before disposing of them to landfill. Our planet is suffocating with waste, and we are adding to greenhouse gas emissions through production processes, inefficient use of resources and landfills. Being Linear doesn’t just cost our environment but also our pockets, as extracting resources from the earth has a significant financial cost. There Is A Better Alternative To 'Take, Make and Dispose' - Climathon NZ We all have a role in this and organisations need to take responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products and services, from the materials they source right through to how they are disposed of and everything between. Recently 14 local and multi-national companies signed up to the New Zealand Plastic Packaging Declaration, committing to use 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or composting packaging in their New Zealand operations by 2025 or earlier. This is a great start. Individuals can have an impact too. A recent survey found that 50 percent of New Zealanders said they were either very or extremely worried about the impacts of waste. We can each create change now by using reusable items such as keep cups, drink bottles and shopping bags, making choices to compost at home, fixing products and buying products made to last. We can also choose to buy items made of recycled materials and say not to unnecessary single-use plastics such as straws. There are more ideas on how you can reduce your waste at mfe.govt.nz. Individual changes will be backed by the Government’s recently announced waste work programme supporting New Zealand’s transition a circular economy. This includes expanding the Waste Disposal Levy to more landfills, improving our nationwide waste and resource recovery data, investing the Waste Minimisation Fund in systems, infrastructure and product innovation that will take us closer to a circular economy, introducing mandatory product stewardship schemes for problematic waste streams such as vehicle tyres, lithium-ion batteries, agrichemicals and refrigerants, and creating an overall strategy for New Zealand’s transition to a circular economy starting with road-maps for key sectors. Innovation is key to our journey, so I am excited to see what the teams can come up with at this year’s Climathon and how their ideas can help New Zealand get one step closer to a circular economy. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/how-to-move-towards-a-waste-free-future-with-a-circular-economy;
wellington03;Wellington;challenge;Sustainable Food Network;Can Wellington create a sustainable food network?;food;The food system has a huge climate impact – it is estimated that it contributes to 30% of global carbon emissions. The food system has a huge climate impact – it is estimated that it contributes to 30% of global carbon emissions. We all eat, and a lot of energy goes into getting food onto our plates – creating emissions along the way in the highly mechanised processes and complex global supply chains associated with the conventional food system. The climate impact of food, however, is not only related to production and distribution – but to how much and what we consume, and how we dispose of food. It is estimated that we waste a third of all the food we produce. We face huge challenges in New Zealand and the world around reducing the emissions associated with the food system. In New Zealand agriculture is estimated to contribute to nearly half of all emissions due to factors including the methane produced by ruminants such as dairy cows. We do not see this reflected in Wellington’s carbon footprint as by and large, food is not produced within the city’s boundaries. However we are a city of over 200 000 people who eat, and as consumers we drive demand for certain kinds of food over other kinds. Local food movements (Local Food Week is an example here in Wellington) have sought to promote local, seasonal food and shorten supply chains. A note of caution, however, is that the local food option is not always the lowest emission option (for example wheat doesn’t grow particularly well in the greater Wellington area) - nor is it always the healthiest. We’d like to leave you with some key challenges and opportunities for Wellington to not only address the climate impact of the food system, but to make the most of climate change mitigation efforts. Are we doing enough to address overconsumption and the carbon footprint of our diet? What is the potential for expanding local food production through urban farming in Wellington? As the population in our City grows and intensifies, what can we do to make the best use of land available for growing – and embed food sustainability in our City? Are there opportunities enhance the sustainability of our food systems through climate change mitigation efforts – for example to include edibles in “green” infrastructure and water sensitive design to cool our city and make it more resilient? How could our food supply chains be more carefully designed – to reduce our carbon footprint and increase sustainability? Could we do more to increase our rates of food rescue and recovery?

wuppertal01;Wuppertal;challenge;Wuppertal gets waterproof;How can Wuppertal protect itself from future floodings and heavy rain events?;water-management;Torrential rains, extreme rains of long duration, emergency situations in many cities in Germany – also in Wuppertal. It is time to prepare for the effects of climate change and for this, citizens and traders have an important role to play. This summer, Wuppertal and many other cities in Germany have been hit by heavy rain. Roads were flooded, in many homes and shops the water was many inches high, the roof of a university building and a gas station collapsed. The costs caused by the storm are considerable. The prevention of floodings and heavy rainfall events and the resulting consequences is a communal task. It serves to protect potentially affected areas such as people, buildings, traffic, the economy, etc. and to avoid costly damages. Municipalities, water management associations and fire departments are also increasingly under pressure, as well as responsible, just like the private sector and local citizens. There are numerous information materials for citizens and shops. Yet: many homeowners and also the industry ignore the warnings and continue to refrain from the simplest protective measures, such as backflow prevention devices in house connection lines. After heavy rain or a flood, awareness is naturally the highest among decision-makers, as well as the public, but it decreases soon afterwards, often to the point of ignoring the issues entirely. Questions to be answered are: How can citizens (but also industry) be sensitized and motivated to not only be aware of the topic but also to do something about it? What are innovative and creative ways to inform affected population groups? How do citizens want to be involved in the planning and implementation of measures in the context of heavy rainrisk management?

But the consequent amount of packaging waste is a danger to the environment. So how can plastic waste be reduced or even avoided from packaging? The registred association Aufbruch am Arrenberg e.V. wants to build a city farm that enables food production in the city. For this purpose, an aqua-ponic farm will be created, which ensures a sustainable production through closed resource cycles. Products will be fish, vegetables, herbs, shellfish and insects. In order to operate a sustainable farm, besides a sustainable production process, it is important to develop and establish sustainable solutions for packaging as well. In order to operate a sustainable farm, the solutions for the following three fields need to be climate-friendly and as garbage-free as possible: Sales packaging of various fresh foods for selling in a shop Outer packaging for storage and preservation of food by production surplus Transport packaging of food for climate-neutral transport systems The legal regulations for foods such as hygiene and cooling and the possibilities of climate-neutral logistics have to be considered.

However, rigid structures that stand in the way of the further development of a neighbourhood are often maintained. The decisions taken in urban planning and the resulting land use and development plans often follow outdated urban planning principles. In many cities, for example, proof of one car parking space per housing unit is still required. What happens to these areas if the requirements in our neighbourhoods are completely different after the switch to e-mobility and car and bike sharing? How can the use of parking areas be adapted to the changing requirements of society and the neighbourhood in the areas of mobility, energy supply and social services? What can a concept for the flexible use of parking spaces look like and how can it be implemented in planning law? A redesigned parking space should be, for example: gradually adapted to the needs of users in the neighbourhood, modular, based on the technological development of the vehicles and types of mobility, the coupling point of a sustainable, decentralised energy supply for the neighbourhood, an area for alternative, social use.

When a customer purchases a plant pot (which can come in multiple dimensions) he also gets a personalized account on the SoulPlant app, which lets them take care of their plants in a simple and straightforward way. The app lets the customer know which type of plants would be most suitable for their home and their needs. Furthermore, the app provides step-by-step guidance to taking care of the plants, for example by giving notifications on watering times. The purpose is to have more and more plants covering the buildings in Zagreb, which can positively impact the urban heat islands issue. The ultimate ambition of SoulPlant is to provide gardens for rooftops of residential and commercial buildings, thereby covering a larger surface area and enabling a greater positive impact. The pots in which we provide personalized gardens are made out of recycled plastic, and the soil is made out of compost and gel balls (which serve to retain moisture).

How can the city of Zajecar develop Sustainable Business Model Innovation in Agriculture Cluster? What are the benefits of building solar parks in agriculture? Can such a model be sustainable for the further specialization of the city of Zajecar? How to empower women and their families through entrepreneurship in the development of sustainable agriculture? Do young people know the importance of food? The main challenge is how to develop sustainable innovative technologies in agricultural production systems in Zajecar so that they meet the specific needs of different categories of producers, small families of farmers, rural households and their organizations? In Serbia, women farmers produce 20-30% less than their men. The main challenge is the empowerment of women and their families through entrepreneurship and farming.  By 2021, it is envisaged that the EU digital agricultural market is spending up to 9.2 billion euros. This growth includes the value of software, algorithms, platforms, and links between agricultural and technological hardware. Digitalization of applications, processes, and technologies gives the sector the ability to become more efficient and productive. The challenge is related to the GIS mapping of agricultural land where can be built several smaller solar parks. The development of clusters for organic farming and the construction of several smaller solar parks located in the south-eastern part of the Municipality of Zajecar would enable the city to make better use of sustainable solar energy connected to better agricultural production.

GIS-based development City Zajecar strategy Sustainable examples and suggestions of technological innovations was presented through the GIS Waste Management Model, electrical mobility, IoT technology in the transport system, and examples of a Circular economy. The assessment of smart and sustainable cities, however, is a major challenge due to the complex, complicated, and chaotic nature of our cities. This makes the available monitoring and evaluation tools difficult to adopt and apply in different urban contexts to support urban planning and governance and foster evidence-based policymaking. In order to address this issue, the solution brings together GIS-based development concept with smart and sustainable cities. GIS-based development is a vision that considers data as the central structuring element of the future development strategy of the city of Zajecar. The best way to respond to the waste management challenge for the city of Zajecar is through the process of entrepreneurial discovery. We presented a draft of the Regional Waste Management Plan, given recommendations related to the private-public partnership for the establishment of a Regional Recycling Waste Collection Center. Sustainable examples and suggestions of technological innovations was presented through the GIS Waste Management Model, electrical mobility, IoT technology in the transport system, and examples of a Circular economy. The patented technology converts organic wastes into a biogas that closes the circular economy loop.  Smart City Zajecar team solutions include: Mapping in GIS, use of drones, video bases and images Full digitization (for example, Wildfire location, main landfills, hydrology, geology, annual temperature, agriculture landfill ...). Smart integrated multi-modal transport system and waste management platform: collection and disposal of waste. Multi-criteria decision-making approach (MCDM) involves the development of a conceptual framework, the attribution of weights by a panel of experts and the application of the model. The model is composed of 16 sustainability indicators grouped into seven impact areas, including air, energy, soil, water, buildings, transportation, and waste. Ecological and efficient electric vehicles that enable quick and accurate waste collection. Self-contained mobile garbage cans, with a solar panel. Through partnership and access from the bottom to the top, smart specialization brings together local authorities, the academic community, the business sphere, and civil society in their efforts to implement long-term growth strategies. It can significantly contribute to the integrated approach on which macro-regional strategies are based. This process could be coordinated at the local level by accredited regional development agencies from East Serbia (RARIS), in close cooperation with local economic development offices (LER). ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/waste-management-gis-system;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/human-behaviour/the-potential-for-better-implementing-adequate-waste-management-in-urban-settlements

Heating installers have a major influence on the choice of new heating systems. What kind of new tool can support installers to influence their clients to choose a greener heating system? The city of Zurich is on its way to a 2000 Watt society. However, more than three quarters the buildings are still heated with oil or gas. The result: heating generates around 60% of the greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, Zurich is supporting the switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Several studies show that heating installers have a major influence on the choice of a new heating system. The challenge is, that installers mostly give advice on a spontaneous basis without proper preparation and data collection. They just don’t have the budget for a proper analysis. The City of Zurich wants to support installers by delivering a simple application, based on energy and building data. The kit will help installers recommending smart and renewable solutions for their clients.

They contribute significantly to a pleasant urban climate in densely built areas. What tool can simulate the impact of green spaces on the urban climate respectively the well-being of the citizens? Green spaces are an important element against the effects of climate change. Green spaces in the city contribute significantly to a pleasant urban climate in densely built-up cities (for example used as cooling, shadow, etc.). It is estimated that public green spaces will only grow slightly and be exposed to increasing pressure of use. At the same time, the green spaces on private ground will continuously decrease because landowners want to maximise the use of their land with high-density construction. These losses of green spaces can barely be compensated through public green spaces. The aim of this challenge is to illustrate the development of the urban green spaces in the public and private environment and to demonstrate the impact green spaces have on the urban climate respectively the well-being of the citizens. The definition of green spaces in this context are the sum of greenery (green-volume) in the city such as trees, bushes, forests, agricultural zones, green roofs, gardens, etc. Solutions: should simulate the future development of the green spaces in the city based on past and present data should include the complete tree mapping from the years 2006 and 2010 from two districts (Schwamendingen and Zürichberg), from which the development of the tree population can be derived.

Game app engaging ZH residents to choose sustainable foods Our mobile application uses fun gamification and virtual as well as valuable incentives to engage people to make positive choices for a reduced impact on their environmental footprint. The assumptions are that the consumer is uneducated about food choices and does not care about sustainability. In Switzerland, the carbon footprint from the average resident is 14 tons of CO2 per year, with a goal of reducing it to 1 ton per year by 2050. It is estimated that a meat lover’s diet produces 3.3 tons of CO2 per year while a plant based person’s diet with local products produces less than a ton of CO2 per person. The impact of our food choices on the environment needs to be reduced and our solution addresses the issue. Our business model: The assumptions are that the consumer is uneducated about food choices, does care about his health and wallet, has little time to shop and does not necessarily care about sustainability. The customer is engaged in a fun, educational and rewarding game, competing on a corporate or social community level while accumulating karma points, which then can be redeemed for insurance premium reduction as done for plant based diets in some countries. Through scanning the grocery receipt, or barcodes on the products, the gamer collects karma points and sees immediately the carbon footprint impact. He/She is able to compete with his/her individual CO2 footprint data, to save the island from sinking, the forest from burning, the city from hurricane, earth from desertification, and the animals from extinction. Points are also accumulated for choosing the suggested more sustainable alternative products on the next grocery or restaurant purchase. The tool would be marketed via our key partners, insurance companies, WWF, restaurants of the city of Zurich, and corporate partners with cafeterias. Our data base comes from several sources which we will ensure are scientific (Eaternity, Open Food Facts). To make the solution viable financially, we intend to create revenue through sponsorships with corporations and restaurants, through sustainable products affiliate programs and user data. ;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/planeteers;https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en//en/challenges/food/food-choice-reducing-climate-impact

That’s why we decided to make our chips rescuing bread from the days before, produced by the best bakeries in town. They are not only irresistibly crunchy, but also deliciously sustainable. 1/3 of Europe's food is wasted (88M tonnes) and thus 1/3 of our resources could be saved. Its negative impact on climate, land, water, and biodiversity and its direct global economic costs of $750B annually make it to one of the most pressing challenges of the food system. Furthermore, bread is one of the most wasted foods next to vegetables and potatoes, with 56% wasted across the entire value chain. And that's why we decided to do something about it and contribute to saving the world - one chip at the time! Our ZüriChips cause half of the CO2 emissions compared to normal chips. This means that by eating 1 kg ZüriChips, you save the equivalent of a 6km car ride. Instead of just reducing negative emissions, we have a positive impact on our planet, which couldn’t make us happier. But we not only want to sell sustainable chips, we also want to deliver a message on how every single person can contribute and thus increase the impact that our chips can have on the world. During the Climathon we mainly focused on developing this message. In the last 24 hours, we developed napkins to be served together with the ZüriChips that can both raise awareness on sustainable eating and help customers make more informed food choices both when they are eating out and at home. At the same time we also adapted the packaging with these messages. ZüriChips tips: WARM UP YOUR FOOD. NOT THE PLANET. Make sustainable food choices. ALL YOU CAN EAT. NOT MORE.

It is organized around the idea of enabling social interactions while promoting a conscious choice about sustainable food consumption. If you love seasonal food and PotLucks, this is the App for you. Zurich is an actively engaging city where people like to eat out in restaurants, cafes and canteens. BBQs are also a common site, especially near the lake, during the summer season. The city boasts a high percentage of socially active singles who make 22% of the total population. Moreover, 30% of the city's population lives in a house or flat or apartment with just one other person, usually a partner. Given the fast paced lives and the fact that we have easier access to ready-made foods and bbq items in super stores, a lot of food gets wasted (roughly 94 kg per person per year). Households account for 45% of this waste per person. Recycling is good, but eliminating overproduction by matching excess supply with demand can help reduce the need to recycle and the need to waste. Zurich is also a multinational city, inviting people from all sorts of places and backgrounds. In fact, 30% of people living in the city of Zurich are not Swiss. Integration and socializing is a daunting task and takes time and effort. People seek for various ways to connect with each other. There are several platforms including clubs, pubs, bars, online platforms (like facebook etc.) that are available to one and all. Most of these fail to provide a platform to combine meeting with like-minded people and showing a passion for conservation through sustainable practices. For instance, whatsapp only enables you to organize an event within your friend circle, if you have one that is. Facebook also allows people to create or join events. But usually you do not know much about people you are going to meet, their views or if you even have a shared vision. Especially when it comes to event surrounding food, there is no dedicated app or platform that brings together like-minded people, advices them on what food to expect during the event and what to cook themselves. Our solution to the two problems stated above is an idea that is surrounded around organizing ""potlucks for the planet"". Our ""Plan-eat"" App for smartphones, let's individuals, companies and NGOs to join PotLuck events that are organized all across the city by people or organizations with similar values and ideas. The app enables an easy checklist for seasonal fruits and vegetables and events can be organized with a seasonal theme - e.g., Pumpkin PotNight. Interested people can see what others are bringing and in what qualtities and also what can be expected from them. Our app's preamble advices people to minimize plastic, bring their own cutleries and cook seasonal and local. Individuals or organizations can create their own events. Events can be classified as ""seasonal"", where the theme and menu is mostly surrounded around fruits and vegetables that are readily available around the time of the event. What's in it for the different stakeholders you ask? For an individual our solution provides a platform to socialize and interact with others move away from the routine food and try something new a way to reduce wastage at home and avoid usage of plastic, especially when outside promote his or her perspective, e.g. by organizing vegan potlucks if you think veganism is the right movement going forward a mechanism for people who enjoy cooking for others (e.g., chefs that want to open their own restaurant some day) to test their skills on people who want to try new things For an organization or an NGO, our solution enables team PotLuck events to bring people, teams and even companies together. Instead of going to fancy restaurants everytime, events can be easily organized to promote interaction with a eco-friendly twist to it.  Moreover,the increase of climate impact awareness and the attendance  these events can have an impact in the community and affect life style, food purchase and consumption choices.

Our webpage aims to promote the idea of being one humanity and protect the shared environment by enhancing the interaction among individuals with different perspectives towards food. This means connecting people using a matching algorithm, taking into account differences and similarities of users. Having a member in our team who is changing her diet to veganism and experiencing a lack of social acceptance of her decision, we concluded that an isolation of different ""eating habit groups"" is a problem of our days. We are convinced that a tool which encourages people with different eating habits to meet and enhances the taking place of such encounters would finally lead to a better understanding of food impact of different diets. Therefore a higher willingness to eat in an environmentally more sustainable way can arise. The main goal of our platform is not to promote veganism, but to generally improve their diet regarding its environmental impact. For example, meetings could be suggested to an user who certainly is not willing to become vegan, where a sustainable usage of meat could be analyzed/learned (e.g. by consuming all parts of an animal). This said, we would, as it has the potentially smallest impact on the environment, embrace an enhancement of vegan nutrition in our society. However, we are convinced that to do so, prejudices and stigmas cannot be present and each diet has to be accepted and respected. With our tool, we think that a good basis for such a social perception can be achieved. FooDialogue provides a platform for exchanging with people who already eat in a more environmentally sustainable way regarding a certain aspect of the impact our food has on the environment. The different categories include CO2 emissions, water concumption, using regional and seasonal productions, ... It is meant to give people the opportunity to get out of their bubble, enlarge their knowledge concerning what they consume and empower them in making a better informed decision on their diet. In a first step the user creates a profile with his/her food habits. FooDialogues then qualitatively ranks the environmental impact of this individual diet. In a second step the user can state an area he would be interested in improving/learning more about: either based on the categories of environmental impacts, specific regions of the world (e.g. Chinese,Italian food,...), specific diets (vegan, vegetarian, ..), a balanced diet (health aspects, nutrients). Moreover the users are asked to specify some organizational aspects such as whether they would be willing to host a dinner at their place/would like to get a recomendation for a restaurant, with how many people they would like to have the dinner, their zip code, how much they would spend for a dinner, languages they speak,... Finally, FooDialogue matches people that can learn from each other and broaden each others horizon.

How can we cool the city together?
As many other highly urbanised areas Zagreb is significantly warmer than its rural surroundings. City itself is heat island, but there are also smaller spaces in the city warmer than others - heat islands.

Challenge context
We are witnessing on daily basis that climate is changing and in context of this specific challenge hot days and extreme hot days are being observed. High level of urbanisation led to the fact that Zagreb is significantly warmer than its surrondings. Apart from that fact there are smaller areas within the city which are warmer than the others and that depend on various factors. Although general metorological measurements exist they are not sufficient to create detailed heat map of the city, as a basis for further actions. There has been some research on this phenomena conducted in Zagreb and there are some ongoing. To sum it up, research is needed and more data is needed. Still, there are some things that can be done based on the existing knowledge and available data. That is where we need you and your ideas!

Challenge description
Do we have enough data?

Are there some examples already in place that show the way forward in creating a solution?

We see different ways of adressing the urban heat islands issue in Zagreb:

Actions streaming forward the urban planning discipline
Technical solutions
Nature based solutions
Others - be creative and innovative

In recent years the generation of waste in urban areas of municipalities has increased, accompanying the increase in living standards and urbanization. A shift towards a circular economy, producing less or even no waste, could be the alternative.


Challenge context
The key challenge lies in addressing waste before it ends up in landfills and/or becomes pollution.

Challenge description
The best way to respond to the waste management challenge for the city of Zajecar is through the process of entrepreneurial discovery. We will present a draft of the Regional Waste Management Plan, given recommendations related to the private-public partnership for the establishment of a Regional Recycling Waste Collection Center.

Sustainable examples and suggestions of technological innovations will be presented through the GIS Waste Management Model, electrical mobility, IoT technology in the transport system, and examples of a Circular economy. The patented technology converts organic wastes into a biogas that closes the circular economy loop.

Do you have an idea that could be key to unlocking the benefits of a circular economy in Adelaide? Capturing the value of a circular economy approach in Adelaide will require keeping products, components and materials at their maximum utility and value. This means:  designing ‚Äòsmart‚Äô products that last longer and can be reused many times sharing things more and making repair the norm recycling materials effectively and converting some waste materials into biofuels displacing fossil fuels and derived products with bio-based materials  This approach opens the door for entrepreneurs and innovators to transform the way we manage resources and think about waste. Consider the opportunities in reverse logistics, and in services and digital technologies that can help create a circular economy.

Air pollution is one of the main environmental and health threats of this era. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) assessment of the burden of disease due to air pollution, more than 2 million premature deaths each year can be attributed to the effects of urban outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution (caused by the burning of solid fuels). WHO believes that reducing levels of one particular type of pollutant (known as PM10) could reduce deaths in polluted cities by as much as 15% every year. The Municipality of Ancona is part of the Italian Network of Healthy Cities promoted by the World Health Organization since 1996, with the adhesion to the aforementioned Network the Municipality of Ancona has decided to reaffirm its role and its commitment to the promotion and protection of health by adopting an inter-sectoral and inter-institutional policy capable of responding to the complexity of the needs that require a high degree of collaboration and integration between the different organizational levels at the local level.  The proposed challenge requires 2 inter-connected and related sub-tasks: 1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sustainable Urban Mobility in response to air pollution. Making urban mobility more sustainable means to reduce city gas emissions. Indeed being Ancona active in industrial, touristic and commercial assests and hosting the administrative offices of Marche region, the university facilities and the Regional Health Headquarters, the urban mobility of Ancona city¬†is one the main problem for air quality. 2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Developing integrated solutions for the City Port Ancona is hosting the regional industrial port. A project solution that involves the passenger seaport and freight/cargo area and the industrial area will help Ancona to organize its activities.¬†

A major challenge for cities in the future will be to meet our need for nature based solutions towards a more resilient city that will be able to withstand climate change and environmental challenges. Athens, a city that suffers from heatwaves, flash floods and poor air quality, has historically wasted, misused and mismanaged its natural resources. It needs a culture change to understand, support, and promote its green infrastructure. The city needs to create, as well as, better manage its green areas. Creating a Tree Inventory is an integral part of Athens Resilience Strategy to integrate natural systems into the urban fabric. An urban tree inventory¬†is the database of accurate information on the health and diversity of an¬†urban green¬†stock.  How concerned & active citizens of Athens, together with expert arborists & foresters, research students & members of the Academia, IT specialists & software programmers, innovative entrepreneurs & local businesses, design thinking facilitators & community-based organizations, along with city officials, can create an open data Urban Tree Inventory that will provide information for the planning, design, planting, maintenance, removal of community trees as well as civic usage of green spaces?¬†Good tree inventory practice involves integrating sustainable design principles, available advanced technologies such as the use of AI applications, excellent knowledge of urban forestry & civic land use, and innovative community engagement that encompasses collaboration and co-creation between city officials and citizens.¬†Solutions that Climathon Athens 2018 could focus on:‚Ä¢ Developing a holistic approach to spatial planning for open green spaces and greener pedestrian streets in the Municipality of Athens.¬†‚Ä¢ Enabling mapping and identification of trees in predefined areas to support public awareness and demonstration activities such as labelling, development, maintenance, etc.‚Ä¢ Assessing the benefits of trees and open green areas using environmental and socioeconomic indicators (assessing the flooding reduction potential, ecosystem benefits, social benefits, cognitive function of green spaces, shading and cooling, urban heat island effect, landscape enhancement, etc.).‚Ä¢ Adapting or creating business models that will support public-private sector collaborations.‚Ä¢ Using design and technology to add value and extend the useful life of current public green spaces.‚Ä¢ Establishing co-creation opportunities between city officials, citizens, local businesses, research centers & universities.‚Ä¢ Enhance and promote public awareness on trees value and importance in the city with any possible ways (e.g. use of technology, stakeholder engagement processes, others).¬†The aim of the Challenge this year is to fuel new thinking, that will ideally include the holistic analysis of satellite, environmental, biological and socio-economic data and the interactions between open green spaces, water attenuation and spatial planning.

To tackle climate change we need to ensure that everyone, from an 8 year old to an 80 year old has their say about how to create sustainable happy communities.¬† Our more disadvantaged citizens need to¬†have a say about tackling climate change in the context of their, often difficult, circumstances. If we don‚Äôt, most plans will fail. Birmingham is a city of 1.1 million people in the city with 408,000 Birmingham citizens in the top 10% most deprived in England. Measures to reduce air pollution, such as clean air zones, have been found to impact those from the most deprived communities hardest, leading to increased financial pressures and reduced mobility. In addition, Birmingham has one of the worst recycling rates in the country, creating more pressures on our environment. Evidence tells us that living happy, fulfilling lives is about far more than money or economic growth. We know that citizens who are connected with and contribute to their communities and adopt sustainable behaviours like collaborating and sharing are happier. They start to demand and take decisions for themselves that support this. Communities that behave in this way also therefore take decisions that reduce climate change. We know that increased wellbeing can have positive impacts on air quality and climate change and that large health inequalities are directly linked to poverty in the city. But sadly, we face some massive challenges to make the connection between wellbeing and the environment - such as the role of the car contributing in part to ¬º of Birmingham children being overweight/obese when they start school (rising to 40% by the time they leave primary school) with over 80% of the population are inactive in the city‚Ä¶ There is much to be done together if we are to make a change. By creating solutions that educate, involve and engage our poorest communities, we have the best chance of creating a city-wide focus on positive impacts for these citizens rather than making them victims of change.  We‚Äôve got 3 we want help with! 1 - How can we give Birmingham citizens a chance for longer, happier lives?¬† What language and actions can we use as citizens to encourage and spread an understanding that real wellbeing comes from caring about your environment, whether that is at a community level or the air you breathe? 2 - How can we make encourage our citizens to feel passionate about the environment they live and work in? Specifically, how can we change Birmingham‚Äôs streets and public places to be cleaner, easier to use, enjoy and look at? How can we give our communities a voice to demand or lead positive change about the place they live in, in a practical, environmentally sensitive way? 3 - Lastly, how can we make our city a more healthy, clean and fun place to travel around on a daily basis?¬† What bothers citizens about waste and dirt? What do they think they can do that that can help tackle climate change with regards energy and fuel consumption, waste and recycling, and what is really achievable in the context of their lives?

Australia is the world‚Äôs second largest producer of waste with the average person producing 2.1kg of waste per day with Queenslanders unfortunately exceeding this figure with the average Queenslander producing 2.3kg of waste each day. Yes these figures are shocking but exactly what do they mean for our environment? The climate impact from the waste industry comes primarily from methane generated from the breakdown of waste in landfills. And although you may not be familiar with this greenhouse gas you should know that methane is 84 times more potent than CO2 over a twenty year period which means that every tonne of methane traps as much heat in our atmosphere as 84 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gas emissions are also associated with the production and distribution of the items that we end up throwing away. So reducing waste and using resources more efficiently can also reduce these ‚Äòupstream‚Äô emissions. So, we now know that Queenslanders produce tonnes of waste and this waste has serious consequences for our climate. What now? Well the good news is that where there are large volumes of waste there are economies of scale, and scale is essential in creating a circular economy. A circular economy is an economic performance based model that relies on system wide innovation to create social, environmental and economic capital In a circular economy resources are kept at their highest value at all times and this economic model provides an alternative to the linear ‚Äòtake, make, use, dispose‚Äô model that our society currently operates within. On another postive note, there is a growing demand from Brisbane residents seeking ways to reduce their personal waste. Businesses that have targeted this niche have found great sucsess in our city. So the time is right for novel solutions to thrive. Looking at household waste, there are a variety of areas to explore.¬†Waste streams to divert from landfill¬†can¬†include, but are not limited to:¬†  Green waste Organic waste Co-mingled recycling Paper and cardboard E-waste¬†(electronic and electrical) Hard rubbish Textile waste  The waste cycle begins with generation, then collection and finally disposal.¬†While many people traditionally focus on disposal there are also opportunities to avoid waste by focussing further up the waste cycle.¬†Participants can explore whether they can find business opportunities in avoiding the generation of waste through reuse or by reducing purchases in the first place.  How can we empower Brisbane households to tackle climate change by reducing the waste they generate? This is the hot topic that will form the challenge for the 2018 Brisbane Climathon. Teams are encouraged to develop business ideas, concepts and creations that provide Brisbane residents with solutions to manage their waste using the top two tiers in the waste hierarchy; Avoid, Reduce and Reuse.

The primary challenge should be an evaluation of mainly meteorological indicators, taking into account the changing climatic conditions on Earth. The city of Brno will provide data from meteorological stations that are managed by the ƒåHM√ö or the city itself. The measured values include NO2, NO4, SO4, CO2, Ozone, PM2,5, PM10, dust and meteorological indicators: wind velocity, max. wind speed, wind direction, maximum wind direction, temperature, pressure, humidity. The challenge is to analyze the data and find the deviations. In a second part, the challenge will be to assess the development of emissions during the period under review (data coverage for almost 20 years). The assessment can disclose anomalies that have occurred and when comparing the time series, it is possible to develop a predictive model for the territory of the City of Brno. The monitored indicators may be comparable to developments at a higher territorial level, e.g. with state or regional values. In order to strengthen its climate resilience, Brno first needs to identify its climate hot spots, where citizens, crucial infrastructure and other assets are at risk. Based on the crucial data evaluation and prediction model, Brno can start building apt mitigation and adaptation strategies.

New approaches for waste collection and recycling can create green jobs. How can technology with innovative business models be combined to tap into ‚Äúsolid waste management‚Äù through the lense of the ""circular economy"".   With approximately 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most densely populated country in the Middle East. In 2011, the volume of municipal solid waste amounted to around 22 million tons per year and this figure is forecast to rise by 3.4% each year due to population growth and changing patterns of consumption. The regulatory framework and the expansion of services and infrastructure cannot keep up with these growth rates. It is estimated that only 60% of the waste produced is actually collected, of which less than 20% is recycled or properly disposed of. While public spaces in some municipalities are kept clean, the situation in other parts of the country is precarious. A significant portion of the waste is disposed into canals, rivers, streets or open areas without any treatment or preventive measures. This causes water, soil and air pollution and spoils the landscape. It also poses a serious risk to public and animal health and negatively impacts the economy, especially the tourism sector. A 2002 World Bank study estimated the cost of economic loss from inadequate waste management at between 0.4% and 0.7% of the gross domestic product. Despite international support, the institutions responsible for waste collection and disposal are not yet able to perform their complex tasks. The legal framework is inadequate, and the allocation of responsibilities and tasks remains unclear. The sector is significantly under-financed and there is an enormous need for sustainable investments and services. [GIZ]  Cairo‚Äôs trash is a commodity, just like oil or wheat, amounting to about 22 million tons annually. Of this amount, potentially 5 million tons can be converted into Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF), and 4 million tons can be turned into organic fertilizer.

How can these challenges be solved in a wetland area taking into account the protection of biodiversity and its sustainability?   Castell√≥n is an area with high water stress. The city, and the whole region, have a high dependency on groundwater for urban supply and the forecasts warn about the impact of climate change in the Mediterranean, thus, it is urgent to take measures to mitigate this impact. ""La Marjaler√≠a"" is a peri-urban wetland associated with the city aquifer where the phreatic water surfaces. It is a crowded and inhabited area that combines residential zone with agrarian exploitations and green areas with high ecological interest. Formerly, Marjaler√≠a remained flooded during the whole year, and it was dedicated for crop rice, but during last 50 years it was drained to avoid diseases and to favor orchards. Currently, a network of pumping wells drains the water, discharging it to ditches and channels that transport it to the sea.  In the past, urban policies did not consider climate change effects, contributing to the construction of human settlements with a greater concentration in certain areas. Currently there are around 3068 homes. Climate change is causing long dry periods with sporadic torrential rain episodes. When a rainy season occurs, if the aquifer's water level is high, the drainage network must be forced to avoid flooding. But if the rains are torrential (cold drop), the system is very compromised, and the risk of flooding is very high, even inevitable in most cases. Added to this is the challenge of making the urban settlement and its needs (energy, transport, economic development, etc.) compatible with the preservation of biodiversity and sustainable development in the wetland.  In this way we ask the following question: How to create a Smart green-wetland in Marjaleria to adapt Castell√≥ to effects of Climate Change? We will work under a comprehensive perspective, focusing on finding ideas in the following areas:  Renewable energy and water management. Urban planning: mobility and construction. Agriculture and food Economic development and tourism  Where ideas are treated and developed in each area, such as:  Evidence of the effects of climate change: adaptation. Understand the ecosystem: climatology, aquifer, agriculture, urban planning, pollution, ecosystem. How do we define mobility in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe marjaler√≠a: only access electric cars, only bicycles, pedestrian zones, smoke-free corridors ...? Ecology of the area: fauna, flora ... should we preserve it? What would it be necessary to do? Agriculture / food: responsible / ecological agriculture? What to plant? It is profitable? Is it sustainable? Water reuse, purification, potabilization, use of hydraulic resources in the area. Energy: solar / wind / mini-hydraulic / biomass / batteries / etc ...

In 2015, Copenhagen adopted a Cloudburst Plan for the entire city in order to reduce the risk of damage from heavy rainfall. The goal is to protect the city from flooding, and, at the same time, will convert the city to a greener and more attractive place to live. ‚ÄúGr√∏nningen‚Äù, a park in Copenhagen also known as Bispeparken, is part of the cloudburst plan as a buffer zone that can store surface runoff during intensive rain. The plan is to modify the existing park into a basin that can handle up to 4700 m 3 water in total during a cloudburst as well as manage everyday rainwater from the nearby area. Socioeconomically, the neighborhood surrounding the park is characterized by high unemployment, low levels of education, and low incomes. The area represents a diverse group of people with many nationalities and different age groups. Most of the locals do not always feel safe in the area. Thus, in addition to water management, it is also a goal to boost the area by creating a social meeting place for the locals. Currently, the park is only used by a few people, and the locals do not feel attached to the park. A school is also located at the Southern end of the park and the school children would like to use the park for outdoor activities and learning.   Create an urban space at Gr√∏nningen that can protect the lower-elevation areas south of the park against flooding by temporarily retaining water Create an attractive green space where locals want to hang out (also in dry weather) How can we use the cloudburst project in Gr√∏nningen to help make the citizens feel safer in their daily lives? Today, many citizens experience the northern and southern park areas as two separate parks. How can we make a unified park despite the busy road running through it?

Through this challenge we are looking for innovative business model, products and project plan to manage waste efficiently.   According to Global Liveability Ranking 2018, Dhaka city scored 38 out of 100 and ranked 139th out of 140 cities, marking Dhaka as the second least livable city in the world. Environmental pollution has been one of the major catalysts behind. Numerous initiatives have been undertaken to date but unfortunately, none of them have been effective enough to bring efficiency in waste management. According to Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) budget for the fiscal year 2018-2019, approximately Bangladesh Taka (BDT) 2,567.48 crore has been set aside as an allotted budget for waste management and, this figure is BDT 182.65 crore higher than the budget allotted in 2017, with the aim to tackle the persevering problem of waste management more effectively. Dhaka‚Äôs solid waste management system has seen no major improvement in the past few years despite various initiatives taken by the two city corporations. After their formation in December 2011, the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) authorities pledged to turn the city into a clean, green, liveable, digital and smart metropolis.  In 2016, approximately 6,000 waste bins were installed around Dhaka city for waste disposal but the plan failed as there were no incentives for the citizens to make the best use of it. Consequently, people continued to throw wastes on the streets and some of the bins were even stolen. Designated spots for waste disposal are not used as per law leading to illegal disposals. These illegal disposals create water clogging throughout the city during rainy days.¬† Lack of awareness and poor waste management system continue to be pivotal causes for the ineffectiveness of the 3R method‚ÄîReduce, Reuse, Recycle. The inadequate waste treatment plant in the landfills at Aminbazar and Matuail continue to be a threat for arable lands, water resources and aquatic lives besides being unable to tackle the heavy load of waste. The marginalized population, in particular, are at great risk from environmental damage since they lack basic facilities such as proper sanitation and waste management facilities, hygienic drinking water, even though they pay a much higher price for obtaining these facilities.   We will try to find innovative and creative ideas to manage waste of Dhaka city efficiently based on Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Our focus will be to explore different business models, new¬†waste management processes and creative policy proposals to address this problem.

Most of the buildings in Dhaka City is deprived of natural ventilation and lighting provisions resulting more energy consumption. City dwellers are not trying to reduce energy consumption. Renewable energy usage is also negligible.    Energy is a burning issue for the twenty-first century Bangladesh. With the ever-growing demand for energy to cope with a developing economy on one hand and the impact of climate change on the natural environment on the other, ensuring an adequate supply of energy and its efficient use has become the key factor for sustainable development.¬† Energy efficiency of a residential apartment building can be positively affected by, greater provision of green, water bodies and open space in the surrounding area, linearity of the shape of floor plate, higher ratio of distance to height of adjacent buildings and higher access of natural light into the indoor spaces. Therefore, land-use planning for future residential areas in Dhaka city should conform to proper guidelines of providing these elements. Increased awareness and incentives to use efficient technology is also vital to improved energy efficiency as higher affordability and ignorance can lead to misuse of energy. A dedicated policy, Renewable Energy Policy of Bangladesh, has been in force since 2009, which envisions having 5% power from renewable energy sources by 2015 and 10% by 2020. The government has established Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. To strengthen international cooperation, Bangladesh became one of the initial members of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the only inter-governmental agency working exclusively on renewable energy. Those endeavors manifest Bangladesh's commitment towards the development of renewable energy.  As of 2017, Bangladesh has the world‚Äôs largest Solar Home System (SHS) program with about 5 million SHS. Over 30 million people are benefitting directly from solar energy and over 100,000 new employment have already been created. Bangladesh is blessed with year-round sunshine (over 300 days per year) and has an enormous potential for solar energy. We have been utilizing solar power wisely and using its experience towards diversifying renewable energy (RE) for maximum use but other sources of renewable energies like wind, water, and solid waste have not been explored that much. Energy efficiency and even its concept is not that much popular among the Citizens. So, we want to explore other sources of renewable energies other than solar to find a sustainable energy solution for this mega city.¬† Unfortunately, sensible use of energy and increasing¬†use of renewable energy in Dhaka City is not going as it should be due to lack of awareness and policy implementation. As the largest consumer of energy in Bangladesh, the energy efficiency of Dhaka City can lead us to achieve sustainable development goals. We are looking for innovative ideas, products, policies, business processes or models and incentive-based¬†models for the city dwellers through which energy consumption in city¬†offices and homes can be reduced or renewable energy usage can be increased throughout the city.¬†

Water utilities, such as drinking water infrastructure, wastewater and drainage can be damaged by storms, sea level rise, and unsustainable policies. Climate change also causes water shortage, affecting over 150 million people globally.   The World Economic Forum Global Risk Report identified failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation and the water crises ‚Äì droughts and floods ‚Äì as the risks with the largest expected global impact over the coming decades (WEF, 2016). Flood events are occurring more frequently causing major damage in urban areas. The frequency and intensity of rain events will increase in the future. Besides flood risk, water shortage is an increasing concern. A recent global study shows that 1 in 4 cities already is water stressed, and climate change and urbanisation will increase the risk for water shortage in peri-urban river basins (McDonald et al., 2014). Water is essential for life. These challenges ask for a systemic approach and a transition in urban planning and urban water management.   Water plays an important role for the liveability of cities. We have to rethink the way we deal with water in our cities to create green, resilient and circular cities, so called Water Smart Cities, where collaboration between businesses, public authorities, researchers and citizens plays a unique part to ensure rapid transition. Many cities, including Dublin deal with increasing risks for water shortage, floods and heat waves so the time is now to find solutions.¬† Following presentations by Dublin water authorities, participants will be given 24hrs to find solutions to the challenges they set forward.¬†

But to design a resilient, zero carbon city, we need to understand how people experience public spaces so we can transform Edinburgh's public realm.    Edinburgh is one of the fastest growing cities in the UK, expected to have a population of almost 600,000 by 2040. Edinburgh's growth will provide new jobs, homes and amenities, but this growth must be carefully balanced to ensure there remains a high quality of life to residents, access to services and opportunities for all communities.¬† Reducing congestion and vehicle airbourne pollution, improving journey times by public transport, realising the lifelong health benefits of walking and cycling, and creating streets and public spaces that support city living for all are key to sustaining our inspiring capital city. The City is developing three major projects over the next 12 months, on which it is currently consulting its citizens:  An action plan for a City Centre Transformation which is vibrant, people-focused and aims to improve the city's community, economic and cultural life; The City Mobility Plan to set citywide transport policy and actions supporting a cleaner, safer, inclusive and accessible transport system, leading to a higher quality of life for Edinburgh residents'; Low Emission Zones - as a step towards protecting Edinburgh's citizens from poor air quality arising from vehicles.  ¬†  Edinburgh's Climathon challenge is how we access and use data of people's experiences in and around the city. There are major projects to pull together ""system data"" of how many people are moving in and through the city - via vehicle, bus, tram, cycle and walking routes - but very little data on how people experience the public spaces in the city centre. We want that data to help transform the city centre over the next decade.  "

Much solar potential in the Metropole Ruhr! According to a study by the RVR (Regionalverband Ruhr), there are about one million suitable roof areas in the Metropole Ruhr that could be equipped with photovoltaic systems in order to generate sustainable energy for public and private households. The determination of the potential of renewable energies for the Metropole Ruhr has shown that the photovoltaic use on roof surfaces has the highest technical expansion potential. At the same time, the use of photovoltaics on roof surfaces is very low in conflicts compared to other energy sources and the legal and economic framework conditions are good for the majority of users.¬† The region could thus make a significant contribution to the state goal of doubling solar roofs in North Rhine-Westphalia by 2025 (see the main areas of action of the Climate Protection Plan NRW 2015). Private, commercial and municipal roof areas can be taken into account here. In the case of self-using owners of private residential buildings and commercial real estate, neither technical restrictions nor a lack of profitability represent the main obstacles to the realisation of the existing solar roof potential. The economic efficiency is given - the decision makers just do not know it or the realisation is often too complex for them.¬†  Good concepts and new ideas are required for the implementation process of solar systems.¬†New business models and forms of cooperation that develop joint ownership of photovoltaic systems. Methods that increase acceptance, knowledge and willingness to invest in solar energy. This is exactly where we want to start with the Climathon 2018 in order to produce great and applicable ideas, so that you can then become reality, so that the city of Essen can achieve its climate goals, decarbonisation!

The city of Ferrara - like many other urban areas in Europe - is experiencing traffic congestion and air pollution. On the other hand, the more peripheral areas of the province undergo a process of depopulation, leading to social disaggregation and paving the way for economic impoverishment, due also to the lack of services - an efficient mobility network first of all - in those areas. That's why the still simple (but great) landscape-symbiosis idea is to make through the existing rich landscape a well inter-connected huge metropolis (from Bondeno on the West to Comacchio on the East with Ferrara in the middle) where people - on demand - could easily and quickly move from a logistic hub to another by boat and bike/bus, thus ""re-using"" what the rich landscape already offers in terms of low-impact mobility infrastructures. The new intermodal mobility solution should therefore positively impact on the whole provincial territory/landscape in multiple ways: in terms of environment/climate (less private cars = less air pollution, less CO2 emissions), at social level (since the peripheral areas will be populated again, improving the quality of living) and last but not least for economic aspects (the re-population of those areas will kick-off diffuse refurbishment/retrofitting measures also at building level and therefore contributing to creating new jobs, while the territory regeneration will also attract new tourists) as well. ¬†  Today, even though nearly 30% of Ferrara inhabitants move by bike (the city is also known as ""the bikes city"") and despite great efforts by relevant mobility actors (such as the mobility agency in support of the public transport), private cars are still largely used for reaching the city from the peripheral areas, as this seems today the most effective mobility option. While this happens, with negative impacts either at environmental or social level, Ferrara has a great mobility opportunity - unexplored so far - in its same valuable landscape (most of the concerned areas are UNESCO or Nature2000 heritage) and orography made of existing waterways and canals, dismissed railways lines, cycle lanes, natural walks. The specific objectives of this challenge are:  identify social and economic needs of the area considered and highlight governance issues needed for implementing the idea; explore possible business model options, identifying the most relevant stakeholders.

A web portal created specifically for this purpose could considerably simplify the steps required to publish the trip effectively and to search for available lifts. AMI Ferrara has established an agreement with the Faculty of Engineering, to create a platform for corporate carpooling for local authorities only. This led to the involvement of various experts and to the first realization of a feasibility study and then to the actual implementation of the platform itself. We started by analyzing the real needs of users in the area, to be able to provide a system that meets the needs of potential users and then increase the likelihood that they use it with satisfaction and security. The platform has been online since June 2016 and the system test phase was launched, in which the mobility managers of the participating organizations participated: Ferrara University, AMI Ferrara, AUSL, the Municipality of Ferrara, the Province of Ferrara, Eni-Versalis and Basell (chemical industries in Ferrara), TPER, HERA group and Ospedale di Ferrara. The ""production and maintenance"" phase of the platform was then started, a phase entrusted directly to a spin-off of the Ferrara Faculty of Engineering (FancyPixel SRL). To further improve this platform, we want to implement several features identified in the software following the ideas and suggestions that emerged during various meetings, in which the mobility managers participated. Parallel to the development, management and dissemination of such software to the interested parties, the possibility of free parking for car pool crews in specially reserved spaces, close to the main entrances, in the parking lot of the Cona Hospital which will soon be regulated for a fee.

This percentage is still valid also when considering only residents that live and work inside Ferrara.   Our cities are more and more congested by cars that citizens use even in cases where the walking distance is affordable, with severe consequences on pollution, natural resource consumption and effects on global warming. It is estimated by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) that the number of cars in use in 2015 in Europe were 333 million [1], more than the total in the whole of America (NAFTA, Central and South America). i.e. 238 million, also considering a worldwide growth of cars in use from 653 to 947 million in the period 2005 - 2015. As many other cities, Ferrara is searching for innovative solutions to face the problem. In fact, while the city has the merit to be ‚Äúthe city of bicycles‚Äù, where almost one third of urban mobility is based on bikes, it still needs to face the problem of vehicular traffic, which causes approximately 29% of CO2 emissions on its territory. [1] http://www.oica.net/category/vehicles-in-use/  Both local authorities and transport companies need to collect data about how and where citizens use bikes or walk, take public transport or use car-pooling, by the use of crowd-sourced data with gamification mechanisms. At the heart of city transportation and smart city mobility planning is the overall reduction of car use ‚Äì predominantly Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV) trips.This so-called mode-shift from SOV to other forms of more sustainable transportation is essentially a society-level behaviour change intervention. Against this backdrop, car ownership has become engrained in our psyche, and people like their cars and the convenience of using them. So, it is not a simple task to target car owners with mass marketing. Even punitive approaches such as congestion charges (applied in different European cities) have not had a material affect because the city is still congested, and it has pushed the congestion further out beyond the congestion charge zone. Therefore, it requires a closer engagement with individuals to deliver appropriate and contextual information about the impact of using cars, and the viable alternatives available. Modal shift is another way of describing behaviour change. It will continue to be the major underpinning of urban transport initiatives ‚Äì moving people from SOV to sustainable mobility, including multi-modal journeys and active travel. This will include creating awareness, educating, encouraging a consideration to change, and tracking the changes. It relates to all modes of travel whether it is existing mature modes such as bus and train, or newer modes like car-pooling, car-sharing, and electric bikes. The specific objectives of this challenge are:  Identify which kinds of incentives may be applied in Ferrara to increase citizens‚Äô engagement and participation in a ""smart city"" approach. Think beyond awareness raising and education. Look into more engaging co-creation approaches and expertise about subconscious decision making and cultural transformations. Explore possible solutions to promote and enable sustainable mobility behaviours, Analyse examples of existing programmes in other cities (e.g. Bologna, Trento, ...) and find out if similar tools and approaches might be replicated in Ferrara   "

Moreover, in the 50% of cases the school is not on the home-work journey of the parents.  The CLIMB Ferrara project (co-funded by Climate KIC) wants to export and adapt the CLIMB solution, already used in Trentino, in the Municipality of Ferrara, scaling it in a different urban context (http://www.smartcommunitylab.it/climb/). This innovative intervention focuses and acts on young generations to address these needs. Education is our best hope and most effective mean to cope with environmental sustainability challenges, since it can empower people with values, knowledge and skills to critically reflect, make informed decisions and act in a sustainable way. Childhood is a privileged time for environmental education: it creates a new attitude of care, respect and sustainable life habits in future generations of citizens and establishes a reinforcement loop spreading the educational impact to their families and the communities they live in.

The faster we replace our gadgets the better. Moving to a circular economy by using and re-using, rather than using up, would yield multiple benefits.    In Norwegian cities and regions we are confronting, as in most cities around the world, with major challenges in relation to the amount of waste produced. Some of the waste might be easy to avoid if our lifestyle could change, but there are countless cases where it is very hard to avoid things like: packaging of goods, buying a new appliance instead of repairing the old one, or when looking at industrial scale the management of byproducts and industrial waste. The goal of introducing a Circular Economy system is to eliminate waste and improve resource management and efficiency, which can actually lead to significant economic, social and environmental benefits.

In most cases they are based on the collaboration and co-creation between producers and consumers. Some examples of circular economy actions that are already yielding positive benefits are: car sharing and car-pooling, object libraries or object banks (renting out objects you only occasionally need, rather than buying them), industrial symbiosis (where a by-product or residual product of one enterprise is used as a resource by another enterprise).

Carbon Neutral Helsinki 2035 action plan includes details how to reduce energy consumption and how to increase on-site renewable energy generation in the city. Helsinki‚Äôs definition of carbon neutrality is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated within the city borders by 80% and to offset the rest.¬† Helsinki seeks to build a functional and carbon-neutral city together with citizens and businesses. The population of Helsinki is estimated to grow from the current 640,000 to 780,000 by 2035. The biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Helsinki is heating. According to the action plan, the city can economically cut the heat energy consumption of buildings with ambitious energy-efficiency upgrades in the old building stock, stricter standards in new construction, heat recovery, and geothermal heating. However in the urban consumption, housing, transport and food are the biggest contributors to the carbon food print of Helsinki. Recent estimates have revealed that the carbon foot print of housing has diminished but the carbon foot print of food products remains the same. Therefore there is a potential to make an impact by creating new innovations for urban food systems including solutions for production, consumption, retail, waste management and energy. Helsinki climate actions can also contribute to the creation of new jobs and sustainable businesses. Tukkutori/Teurastamo district¬†(The City of Helsinki Wholesale Food Market) is an old wholesale and warehouse area located in central Helsinki. The area also used to be a location of a large abattoir but the old butchery now has a new life as a restaurant complex.¬† The district can be divided into two parts; the former abbatoir area Teurastamo where the majority of the buildings have already been renovated and transformed into locations for restaurants, bars, events and pop-up markets. The other part is Tukkutori that is still an area for wholesale and logistics. Also a freezing plant owned by the City of Helsinki occupies one corner of the area.¬† Although in Teurastamo the small scale food factories already operate and the restaurants have been opened, the full potential of the area as urban food hub of Helsinki is still underdeveloped.¬†  Helsinki Climathon challenge is to develop the Tukkutori/Teurastamo district to become a sustainable and commercially viable urban food hub.¬† The Helsinki Climathon challenge in 2018 wants to inspire students, researchers, companies and citizens to think fresh ideas for:¬†  Sustainable and commercially viable urban farming and food production ecosystems  ¬†OR  Teurastamo/Tukkutori area becoming a well-functioning local economy in food retail and consumption by engaging the local produces and residents, by arranging last mile logistics and by local marketing   "

Climate change means warmer summers and drier winters, so we might not be able to cultivate productive vineyards and olive groves anymore. Water scarcity threatens agriculture and our quality of life significantly. Extreme weather means higher risk of fires, floods, destruction of agricultural production. Extensive use of cars for transportation and ineffective waste management makes city life more hectic.  ""Flexible"" or insufficient policies, together with the lack of environmental education for a large part of the Cretan population (especially evident in older generations) further adds to the problem.

Climathon-ƒ∞zmir18‚Äôs Priority Problem Area?  Turkey's water needs on a global scale study conducted in 2030 for 30%, 40% increase in energy requirements is expected. Such an increase in demand will cause undesirable negative effects on ecological balances. Since the past, the city of ƒ∞zmir has been positioned by different civilizations on the basis of eden intercontinental trade. In 1923, in the same way as the first economic program of modern Turkey it was determined to follow in Izmir Economy Congress. Secondly, the Izmir Development Agency prepared the Izmir Regional Plan 2014-2023 document by bringing together the different components of the city such as civil society, academia and business world. As indicated in this plan, the priority areas of the city are built on, Strong Economy, High Quality of Life, Strong Society.  In this context, we can read the background that the city expresses itself through multilateral economic relations and plan economic models. When we look at the relationship between climate change and economy, we face a mutual process. In international platforms such as the European Union and the United Nations, discussions on the current form of the process and its future needs, are ongoing and models are suggested. One of the models developed by the developed countries is called Sustainable Economy or Circular Economy. With its renewable energy sources, ƒ∞zmir has the advantages of transforming the existing production and service delivery model into a sustainable economy model with its qualified work force and universities specialized in different fields. However, this transition is in areas where the process is painful. In summary, these problems;  How can we improve waste management? Waste management is a series of processes that involve the design, production, waste disposal, recycling and / or disposal of any product from design to production. In order to extend the use of existing products within the framework of prevention principle in waste management, the stages of repair, maintenance, renewal are also important. It is aimed to recover the wastes that cannot be prevented by means such as recycling and energy recovery. With an innovative perspective in integrated waste management, especially in storage and disposal processes, waste management processes can be improved and positive benefits can be achieved for ƒ∞zmir economy. How can we apply the circular economy model? In contrast to the traditional ‚Äòlinear economy model, the circular economy is a model in which both the consumer and the producer take responsibility for ensuring sustainable production of limited resources. In parallel with the increase in the global population, the model has started to be discussed by decision makers with the correct increase in energy and raw material needs. In this system, there are stages such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy and reducing carbon footprint. There is a need for structural reforms in the economy through an innovative approach to the transition to the circular economy. How can we reduce the carbon footprints of office / administrative administration buildings? Businesses can minimize the impacts of climate change not only in the production process but also in small steps they can take in offices. For example, the separation of waste such as paper, glass, plastic, and the realization of lighting on the basis of energy efficiency are some of the measures to reduce the carbon footprint. Innovative solutions can increase the impact of combating climate change, especially in offices where white-collar workers work intensively.  "

That being said, simply replacing the petrol / diesel engine with an electric motor will not be enough to meet energy and climate challenges.   The electric car brings undeniable advantages compared to conventional cars: almost no pollution or CO2 emission when used, less noise at low speeds. There are environmental problems with production in other countries, but the overall ecological balance is largely positive, particularly in the case of Switzerland, because of the predominantly renewable source electricity consumed in that country. Indeed, the source of production of electricity consumed is a key factor at the environmental level. That being said, all the other problems related to the quantity of cars in circulation will not be solved by this substitution of engine in cars (territorial grip, traffic jams, cost of diplacement, road accidents, depletion of natural resources, pollution in producing countries, etc.).  Based on the observation that replacing a petrol / diesel engine with an electric motor will not be enough to meet the energy and climate challenges, the challenge is to think of collaborative and shared mobility solutions dedicated to electric mobility. Beyond the bicycle and conventional public transport (not the subject here), the modes of movement and use of vehicles must be redesigned and evolve towards including car sharing and large-scale carpooling. The scope of solutions should concern the inhabitants of the Canton de Vaud, taking into account the specificities of urban areas and peripheral regions. On the other hand, even if electric 2-wheelers are not necessarily excluded from the reflection, the emphasis should be on 4-wheeled vehicles, because it is the current fleet of cars that must be replaced, with a search for seating optimization. This therefore concerns passenger cars, ranging from a cart to a minibus. The proposed solutions can be operated by any type of actors; this may be the responsability of either a public transport operator or a municipal administration, or private people wishing to share their private car with neighbours. We can also imagine intermediate models of the cooperative type of neighborhood association that offer a mobility service, more or less locally, or other ideas... Instructions to participants:  Participants will consider the advantages and disadvantages of electric mobility versus traditional individual mobility, as well as synergies with shared modes of use. The solutions proposed by the participants will have to take into consideration and use existing and mature technologies or close to being. For exemple, a driverless shuttle is at the crossroads of what can be envisaged, as pilot projects have in part proved their worth. Proposed solutions must be linked to service offerings allowing pooling and the emergence of solutions.   "

This mobility generates strong CO2 impacts, especially since the fastest means of transport are often preferred. The University of Lausanne is now considering what professional mobility policy should be put in place taking into account the issue of sustainability and scientific excellence. The question of the mobility of researchers has been identified and there is a real interest from the University of Lausanne to think and find solutions to address it. Participants will determine:  Tools to minimize researchers' travel ; Means or criteria to be used to define the relevance of a trip ; Ways to promote the transfer to greener modes of transport ; Proposals to manage the consequences that this implies for researchers' schedules.

The costs of road congestion are multiple. Its impacts are experienced on a daily basis by thousands of motorists trapped in endless traffic jama, and by companies suffering from increased delivery times or emplyee delays. Road congestion also increases greenhouse gaz (GHG) emissions due to the excess fuel consumed in traffic jams, and this also has health implication since car pollution increases the risk of asthma, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stress, etc.¬† The A1 motorway between Lausanne and Geneva is one of the busiest highway in Switzerland and this creates not only economic costs but also frustration among commuters and a high environmental pollution rate. That might also add a loss of productivity and impact the Swiss economy. Projections show today that traffic to the part of the A1 will continue to grow.  Today, thanks to the anonymous and aggregated mobility profiles of mobile phones (while respecting and preserving privacy) , it is possible to analyse mobility flows and to find new solutions to motivate commuters to use alternative modes of transportation to reduce the pollution, or even to opt for other solutions, such as home office working. Swisscom, as part of the Climathon 2018, wants to understand how it could be possible to encourage commuters who live between Lausanne and Geneva to use alternative modes of transportation such as public transportation, carpooling, cycling, etc., even to opt for home office working. Two working hypothesis could be verified:  Commuters use their cars during rush hours to go to their place of work. They are therefore responsible for the excessive traffic on the motorway. Is the number of vehicles responsible for the congestion? Are there other factors that justify traffic jams? Is it a personal preference to use private vehicles because commuters think that it will be faster this way?  To meet this challenge, Swisscom, as part of its Smart City and Corporate Responsability programs, provides population anonymous and aggregated mobility data that can be leveraged. These data allow a representation of a large part of the mobiliy. In addition, Swisscom encourages the use of its open data that can be found on the following website: https://opendata.swisscom.com/pages/home/ The data analysis could notably make it possible to:  Notify travelers when the highway is overloaded ; Plan efficiently public transportation or other modes of transportation such as carpooling, bike-sharing, etc. Reduce the impact of mobility on the environment.  Instructions to participants:  Participants will find solutions to analyze and exploit data made available by Swisscom and its partners to reduce the impact of mobility on the environment. Participants will use and integrate the data in their solutions. Solutions will reduce the environmental impact of commuters' flows.   "

Climate change scenarios for the Salento region show us that temperatures will considerably increase in the future, hot days will become more frequent in number, rainfall patterns will be altered: it will rain less during the year, but heavy rainfall will increase and be produced by fewer, more intense events.¬†These changes have several consequences for cities, where the microclimate is defined by urban heat islands, and where intense precipitation events can affect the urban drainage systems. These conditions can influence the health and welfare of urban residents, the security of urban infrastructures and the quality of the urban environment.  There are many solutions to address these societal challenges, some of which are inspired and supported by nature. They are the so-called Nature Based Solutions and arise from the growing awareness that some of the most effective and robust responses to these issues are based on the use and developing of some of the features of natural ecosystems. Ultimately, it‚Äôs about ‚Äúinnovating with nature‚Äù to develop solutions that improve and implement the natural capital of our cities, avoiding its erosion and consumption. Putting in place this kind of responses to climate change means to also evaluate pros and cons, the costs in terms of economic and natural resources and the final benefits by an in-depth analysis taking into consideration all the useful perspectives to achieve a positive outcome. For that reason, Climathon Lecce launches a challenge focused on urban green spaces as a solution for a more resilient city in order to adapt to climate change and mitigate its impacts on cities. The city of Lecce encourages Climathon participants (experts, students, anyone who feels they can actively contribute) to propose ideas and solutions that imagine the green spaces as urban infrastructures which are able to improve conditions in cities while taking into account some specific phenomena correlated to climate change, such as urban heat islands and extreme precipitation events in urban areas.

Research shows that improvements can lead to significant economic, social and environmental benefits.   A major challenge for cites and the wider environment is the accumulation of plastic waste, especially single use plastic waste which is inherently difficult to manage in a sustainable manner due to the composite nature of the material finished product and insufficient collection, reprocessing and end of life uses available. The demand by consumers and producers for cheap, light, durable and versatile materials for packaging in particular but also for use in end products has led to plastic content becoming ubiquitous within urban settings and resource flows, however the value of materials is lost at best to landfill or incineration and at worst to polluting our seashores, rivers and ocean depths,¬†which is compounded by the global environmental impacts that result in climate change, air and water pollution and the harm caused to wildlife in our oceans. ¬†  How can London together with industry and citizens eliminate plastic waste and transition from Waste Management systems to Resource Management Systems using culture, design, organisation and waste stream data? Good circular economy practice involves integrating sustainable design, production, distribution, consumption and disposal of materials back into the material and resource flows, and requires collaboration and co-creation between producers and consumers. At one extreme, it encompasses social and cultural practices with regards to decisions made regarding whether an activity is undertaken (e.g. food on the go), and haven decided that it is desirable, the other extreme then considers how can it be done in a manner which is complimentary to natural environmental and future resource flows (e.g. easily compostable or re-usable packaging, cutlery or materials).

Some types of plastic can be easily and profitably recycled while others are not recyclable, at least not with a reasonable economy compared to incineration.";https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/waste-management/solutions-to-limit-the-climate-impact-of-plastic;Plastics are both a blessing and the cause of a lot of problems. How can we change our usage of plastics to keep the benefits while limiting the problems?   Yearly around 280 million tonnes of plastic are created. Plastics are used in most product groups but the largest categories after packaging are buildings, automotive and electronics. Plastic is a very versatile and useful material with advantages in many areas. In many cases the alternative to plastics are expensive, less suitable and have large environmental disadvantages. At the same time, there are huge problems with our current extensive usage of plastic. Plastics commonly have fossil origin, which contributes to CO2 emissions in their end of life phase. Yet another problem is that many plastic materials release toxic substances and degrade into microplastics, with uncertain health effects that are widely spread in nature. Littering and plastic in the oceans are other well-known problems.  In Sweden, packages fall under the producer responsibility, which leads to some material recovery of plastic consumer packages. However, the collection rate is low compared to other waste fractions, around 50%. A large share of the plastic packages that are collected are not recycled but incinerated. Plastic products other than consumer packages are not covered by producer responsibility. Of all the plastics used in Sweden, only 16% is recycled. The Swedish recycling rate is still high compared to the EU or globally.  What makes recycling of plastics complicated is that there are many different types of plastic materials and also several additives, and they need to be separated into different recycling streams. Some types of plastic can be easily and profitably recycled while others are not recyclable, at least not with a reasonable economy compared to incineration. The five most common types of plastics are:  PE (Polyethylene) the most common type of plastics used in packaging but also common in other applications. PE is easily recyclable.  PP (Polypropylene) the second most common type of plastic used in packaging. Common in plastic films and food packages. PP is easily recyclable.  PS (Polystyrene) frequently used in single use items and as insulation, both in packages and in the building sector. PS is expensive to recycle in relation to the value of the material.  PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) This type of plastic is commonly used in the building sector due to its durability and inherent fire-retardant properties. It often contains unhealthy additives. PVC could be recycled if there were large quantities of it that did not contain too much additives. Currently PVC is a large obstacle for recycling when it is present in PE or PP material flows. PVC may release toxins when incinerated.  PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) is used mostly for textiles such as fleece clothes but the second largest usage is plastic bottles. The bottles in the Swedish pant system can easily be recycled but other PET-fractions are recycled to a lower extent.  Climathon in Lund will focus on finding solutions to limit the climate impact of plastic. To reach set targets we need new ideas and business solutions in a number of areas. Here are a few examples:  Development of bio-based, plastics and finding sustainable feedstock‚Äôs for plastic materials Ways to decrease the usage of plastic materials / ways to encourage more sustainable use of plastic materials Digital solutions to track plastic materials through the entire value chain Design of circular material flows for plastic materials New sustainable product designs that can change our perception/behaviour on plastics. Solutions on how to reuse plastic items Ways to enable households and companies to better sort plastic waste Better solutions to sort collected plastic waste Ideas on how to expand recycling of plastics from packaging to building waste, automotive parts, electronics, textiles and other consumer items Business solutions that increase demand of reused plastics  Note that we will also hold a panel debate on this topic with leading researchers and industry representatives 11/10

Western Australia‚Äôs South West, including Mandurah, is a noted international biodiversity hotspot; home to a number of endemic flora and fauna that are highly impacted by current changes to our natural environment. The City of Mandurah boasts Ramsar listed wetlands, plays host to a range of migratory shorebirds and is well known for the critical habitat it provides to vulnerable wildlife, including the western ringtail possum, black cockatoo and fairy fern. Recently, the Mandurah Environmental Volunteer Action Committee has identified that local wildlife plays an important role in connecting our community with nature and is passionate about ensuring these animals have the best chance for continued survival.  An identified hurdle for local fauna is the decline in available habitat, particularly trees. While the City of Mandurah has designated tree protection areas in areas of environmental significance, more can be done to increase the percentage of urban tree canopy. This would be of benefit to both our local community in reducing the impact of urban heat island effect, and our wildlife, by providing them with additional opportunities for foraging, nesting, roosting and protection from predators. The City of Mandurah encourages Climathon participants to propose ideas and solutions to encourage local residents, businesses and organisations to get involved managing urban tree health, to reduce the rate of decline in local trees and increase wildlife corridors and creating fauna-friendly gardens.

Marbella is already working on this with its Strategic Plan which prioritizes pacification of traffic, the reduction of motorized traffic and the promotion of electric mobility.   The Marbella Strategic Plan is an instrument developed through public participation and consensus, and reflects each and every association, expert, technician and institutional and public board which has manifested itself in a series of impressions on the needs and possible solutions that Marbella must embrace in order to face the future in a rational way. A future city model that both the city in general and all the different political parties must unite around for the common good. An Urban Strategic Plan is simply a vision of the city that we all want as citizens. A long-term model of a city we would like to live in and pass on to future generations. An urban quality space that allows for economic and social development in way that is sustainable over time while preserving its natural and cultural heritage. There is a clear public demand for sustainable mobility.  The sustainable mobility strategy has been widely supported during the participation process as one of the most demanded priorities for the city. Creating a more friendly, sustainable and vertebrate city as a guiding principle that advocates non-motorised uses in the modal use hierarchy. Sustainable mobility means ensuring that our transport systems meet our economic, social and environmental needs while minimizing their negative impact. It is aimed towards improving public transport and the pedestrian conditions of urban space and the commitment to non-motorised means of transport, achieving a balance between the urban roles of employment, residence, tourism, leisure and trade. They play a key role in this public policy strategy to promote the criterion of proximity, favouring a compact city development in terms of its structure as a support for the different urban uses, and diverse and complex in terms of developing the roles and uses generated within it. Part of this goal is also to create several centralities within the city where the principle of proximity of the residence-employment-leisure roles is present. Some actions are provided:  Programme for the improvement and promotion of local public transport and a Metropolitan Transport Consortium based in Marbella. Promote traffic pacification and reduction within the city through active and passive policies. Measures for the location and construction of public parkings to deter the access to the consolidated city, with connection to public transport and non-motorised modes. Promote cycling not only as a leisure activity but as a common form of transport within the city. Create bicycle lanes in new sectors and interconnect them with the existing network, which must be comprehensive throughout the municipality and complemented with bicycle-parking areas and a local bicycle-hiring system. Measures for the renewal of the fleet of municipal vehicles and their replacement with non-polluting vehicles. Measures for the implementation of areas with a maximum speed limit of 30 km/h inside the consolidated city.

Like for other villages in the South of France, connection with an irrigation network is impossible. Vine growers are seeking solutions... and Murviel wants to join this effort!   Climate change has major impacts on vineyards in the Mediterranean basin. Harvests happen earlier and harvest conditions are made more difficult by the heat. Indeed while while rains are becoming rare, the need for water increases in vineyards. Moreover, plots are subject to erosion phenomenons, worsened by more frequent extreme climatic events, especially in autumn.Many vineyards, like in Murviel-l√®s-Montpellier, are located in hillside areas. The soil is shallow, stony and conains few organic matter. Both surface and deep water resources are reduced in summer. These territories cannot benefit from extensions of the local collective water network. They are also the most sensitive to the risk of fire and erosion.These territories are classified through geographical indications. Viticulture plays an important role in rural municipalities. It contributes to the local economy and employment, while maintaining the landscape and encouraging rural tourism. Considering the current expansion of fallow lands, vines have a major role in preventing fires. Viticulture, through its growing committment into organic agriculture, also contributes to biodiversity in landscapes made up of mosaics of vineyards, olive trees, woods, scrubland and other crops.2000 people are living in Murviel-l√®s-Montpellier. It has 150 hectares of vineyards, managed by 8 domains, and other grape growers that are members of 2 wine cooperatives. Murviel is a typical example of a rural vine-growing municipality in the South of France. A major part of its territory is located in the watershed of the Mosson river, and it is only 15 km from the Mediterranean Sea.Vine-growers have begun to modify their practices to adapt to climate change: planting later and choosing drought-resistant grape varieties, incorporating compost into the soil and managing the environment ... They shared their concerns with elected officials and their representatives in professional organizations. For this Climathon, we want to relay their concerns, and promote the search for local solutions.  The global challenge is to find solutions by mobilizing local resources (biomass, water, soil, know-how ...) but also scientific and technical knowledge available. Within this frame, different paths for adaptation can be mentionned. In order to start and feed this 24-hours event, a few questions have been pre-identified and validated with stakeholders.  How can vine varieties evolve in the territory? Grape varieties, locations, rhythms and methods of planting ... How can we build water reserves for summer irrigation in hillside areas?

Seed Library is an effective mechanism for collecting and distributing seeds. The goal of Seed Library is to protect biodiversity in food system and promote public access to seeds.   For millennia, people the world over have selected the best edible plants, saved the seeds, and planted and shared them in sophisticated, locally adapted breeding projects that created the vast array of foods we rely on today. In a time of climate change, biodiversity is what we need to assure food security and resilience. Community seed libraries are an effective mechanism for collecting and distributing seeds. The goal of community seed libraries is to protect biodiversity in food system and promote public access to seeds. Why are community seed libraries important? The purpose of the community seed libraries is to protect seed diversity of edible species and to maintain heritage varieties. Community seed libraries help communities save seeds while adapting them to local soils and climates. This has become more critical in a changing climate. Saving seeds by growing them out and exposing them to the fast-changing environment, increases our adaptability as well as the resilience of our food systems. We also want to save heritage seeds so they are not lost. Seed viability of stored seeds can decrease over time, so we need to keep growing them out to produce fresh seeds to save. Why is our community, our public library, city and municipality itself interested in a community seed library? Some people want to grow their own vegetables because they want to know where their food comes from. Some people want to grow their own food to save money. Community seed sharing ties in nicely with the mission of community gardens, especially in urban areas.¬† Gardens can help to combat climate changes ‚Äì particularly if they are in the city. This is a brief summary of key areas in which gardens can also make a difference to changing climate:  Increasing the presence of vegetation will increase the water infiltration capacity of the soil, which in turn leads to better adaptation to future needs in terms of storm water runoff. By providing shade, increasing evapotranspiration and transforming sunlight into vegetal material in photosynthesis processes rather than absorbing it, plants and trees have a cooling effect on their environment. When using more drought-tolerant plants, water needs for irrigation can be reduced. Because of the increased water infiltration, capacity the groundwater table will rise improving drought resistance. When planting more saline vegetables and drought-tolerant vegetation there will be more food available during dry spells. Urban farming and gardening attract a variety of fauna and thereby increases local biodiversity. Moreover, gardens are used as recreational areas and public meeting places for people, improving the environmental qualities of urban¬†   At our first Nova Gorica Climathon we will work towards developing the first community seed library in Slovenia. Community seed libraries are an effective mechanism for collecting and distributing a variety of heirloom, rare, and culturally important seeds that are typically not available from seed companies. The goal of community seed libraries is to protect genetic diversity in our food system and promote public access to seeds. Initially, seeds are donated and collected at library, and then community members can check seeds out and grow them on the condition that a portion of the freshly grown seeds will be donated back to the library. These seeds are then stored and made available to others who continue to contribute to this cycle of taking seeds, growing them and donating a portion back to keep the collection viable, healthy and fresh. The main function of community seed libraries centers on the protection and public access to seeds; however, we will also run training days and workshops so that community members who may be interested in starting their first garden or learning how to hand pollinate squash can learn these skills and put them into practice. In terms of climate changes, community seed libraries are directly connected to urban farming and gardening. As we know areas used for urban farming and gardening, when compared to paved or asphalted grounds, have a positive contribution to climate adaptation. These green areas can be further adapted to climate impacts by introducing appropriate vegetation and crops for allotment and vegetable gardens. They should be, according to the climatic area resistant to droughts; such as saline vegetables and drought-tolerant plants and trees. Honored process of saving and sharing seeds is dynamic. It naturally adapts to changing conditions, like climate change, and keeps the power with people everywhere to make choices that assure local resilience. The seed in its essence is all of the past evolution of the Earth. We will search solutions for:  Establishment of first community seed library in Slovenia Wireframe of community seed library system Sustainable model of project Dissemination of project Possible partnerships in the future   "

The Resilience Strategy will also allow Rome to implement integrated solutions to cope with Climate Change. Proactive citizens are an invaluable resource to achieve such goals.   Rome faces severe climatic impacts related to its heat island, whose negative effects are intensified by high traffic density. Moreover, heavy precipitations can cause frequent flooding and exert strong pressure on the system of its critical infrastructures. Its complex urban fabric seems to be particularly sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation regimes can exacerbate the negative interactions between the urban heat island and pollution, heat waves and very local convective precipitation phenomena. On the other hand, the level of risk to critical infrastructures can rise significantly due to the increased frequency and intensity of extreme events. A major issue introducing further complexity is the fragility of the territory and the presence of the largest Cultural Heritage in the world: these facts act as constraints which reduce the possibility of providing breakthrough solutions to Rome‚Äôs problems. In particular, existing historical and architectural settings demand specific attention to their conservation. Complex problems magnified by complex constraints provide an extraordinary test bench for new ideas on mitigation and adaptation policies against climate change.  The key objective of Climathon Rome is finding new ideas for coping with climate change-enhanced impacts. It addresses the mitigation of the heat island, pollution reduction (mostly that induced by vehicular traffic), the protection from flash floods impacting on the system of critical infrastructure. Ideas for novel solutions will be solicited from citizens, particularly young people, from the research and the academic communities, and from the industrial sector. Entrepreneurial action will be stimulated to drive and support innovation and policy design, and responsible citizenship promoted to make change happen. Contributions should address (but not be limited to) the following questions:  How can green areas contribute to mitigating heat island effects? How can public transport become more efficient and reduce the large use of private transport? How can impacts of extreme events (flash floods, heat waves) be reduced by improving preparedness and resilience? How can innovative monitoring systems support the reduction of urban pollution? ¬†¬† ¬†

It is not a question of staging a war between motorists, pedestrians and cyclists (all people are depending on the means they choose) but rather to implement policies and initiatives to educate the responsibility and mutual respect between road users.";https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/challenges/mobility/universal-mobility;"Rovereto administration wants to promote cycling and slow mobility in general, including the theme of ‚Äúpedestrianlity‚Äù and architectural barriers. Not only in terms of more bike and pedestrian routes, but also with a series of measures fostering more trips by bike and on foot.   By the Decree n¬∞ 18/2016 the Municipality of Rovereto set the speed limit of 30 km/h on all urban roads except in some streets (the main corridors) where the limit of 50 km/h remains. The Municipality has defined as ""residential areas"" all the roads subjected to 30 km/h speed limit, not affected by the passage of public transport. The model ""50/30"" is very used at European level to define, through a classification of the roads, a different hierarchy between the different means of transport in the use of the road spaces. The limit of 30 km/h reduces accidents, improves the perception of safety of pedestrians and cyclists, improves the liveability perceived by residents. Law January 11, 2018, No. 2 ""provisions for the development of mobility on bicycles and the implementation of the national cycling Network of walkability"" (so-called ""framework Law on cycling mobility"") supports this concept. The Law represents a new important reference that, for the first time in Italy, establishes the importance of a policy of promotion of the bicycle as an ideal means of transport not only for tourist and recreational activities but also for systematic movements in the cities. Among the various significant cues introduced by the law, a particular emphasis is put in the definition of ""Ciclovia"" as a ""safe and comfortable"" path for bicycles. Among the types of paths that can be called ""cycloways"" the law introduces ""Roads 30"" and ""residential areas"".  The principle of traffic moderation can often be quickly implemented through low-cost interventions. In some cases it is necessary to associate the implementation with more complex interventions involving a more substantial overall requalification of the road. In both cases it is advisable to associate to the measures to impose the speed limit of 30 km/h also ""physical"" interventions on the roadway able to guarantee that the limit is respected. In many of the urban contexts, typically the neighborhoods but also the historical centres, this creates the conditions for which the realization of cycle paths dedicated (""separated"" or ""segregated"") not only does not serve, but is even discouraged, because it limits the permeability of the road compared to pedestrian and cycle movements. On the contrary, ""integration"" of different means of transport, if well supported by the interventions on the road, represents a winning policy, able, more generally, to improve quality and safety. This paradigm shift needs to be well communicated to the citizens, who must empower themselves and educate themselves to mutual respect. It is not a question of staging a war between motorists, pedestrians and cyclists (all people are depending on the means they choose) but rather to implement policies and initiatives to educate the responsibility and mutual respect between road users. The participants will discuss the different types of ""material"" interventions on the road and ""intangible"" marketing interventions of sustainable mobility that can find effective implementation in Rovereto and in general in the cities. The success of these policies is often dictated also by the ability to engage and directly empower citizenship on the subject. These processes can exploit the innovative potential of urban regeneration initiatives, the development of Community neighbourhood relations, and pilot interventions.  "

Relevant investments have been planned starting from 2018. In which way can the administration address and support strengthened public transport offering to increase public transport users?   Local public transport in Rovereto has developed over the years, from urban transport service in the city of Rovereto towards transport service for the entire territory surrounding the city (Vallagarina). Service users have increased over the years, till 2013. In 2014 and 2015 users decreased. Students represent 70% of the users, whereas workers use the service sporadically.Public transport covers 12% of urban travels, and 31% of travels from outside the city (8% by train).Modal shift from private motorised means of transport to public transport positively impacts on the quality of traffic, in particular if the strengthened public transport service will be perceived as competitive by the workers, responsible of those systematic flows that afflicts traffic during more critical rush hours. Strengthening of public transport means making it appealing to users in terms of frequency, seating capacity, speed, timeliness, comfort, information, accessibility.  In order public transport can contribute to the achieving of the objectives of a more sustainable mobility, it is necessary to give it desirable characteristics in terms of frequency, capacity, speed, regularity, comfort, accessibility and information. Our recent review of the Public Transport Mobility Plan related to the area around the city of Rovereto has shown that the acquisition of new users is attainable by improving frequency and service on some high potential demand routes between the suburbs and the city centre (""strong axes""). Thanks to additional resources this enhancement will be implemented already since 2018. It is really important that our commitment in terms of service improvement produces a a real increase in users and a corresponding reduction in private motorised traffic, both for environment and human health objectives and to reduce the pressure of cars on the centre of the city. To achieve these objectives, in addition to strengthening the transport offer, indirect measures can be investigated (e.g.: discouraging parking in the city centre, traffic restrictions, services for modal interchange, etc.) or measures of to facilitate paradigm change (mobility management, information to users, communication, incentives, etc.).Furthermore, innovative and flexible forms of public transport service can be studied and eventually tested at a pilot level. Participants are invited to discuss this type of initiative.  "

The pressure of traffic on the incoming roads and on parking lots is strong. Reduce this pressure without loosing attractiveness particularly pertains to the economic activities that operate there, but also the residents, the workers, the ""City users"".   In recent years the city of Rovereto has considerably widened the offer of car parking lots located in strategic positions around the city centre: from the oldiest historical parking ""Rovereto Centro"" in Via Manzoni, ""Historical center"" of Via dei Colli, "" Station ""of Via Riva,"" Follone ""of Piazzale Leoni (enlarged in the years), to the more recent parking ""City Hall"", the parking"" Urban City"", the Parking ""Hospital ""and the future ‚Äì it will be completed soon - parking lots ""ex Bimac""and ""Palazzo Balista"". The city centre provides about 2000 parking stalls with additional payment (currently) and 1200 stalls in car parks (currently and under planning). At the same time, the ZTL (‚ÄúLimited Traffic Zone‚Äù) has been enlarged with flexible access conditions in terms of time slots (e.g. Tartarotti Street with ZTL nocturnal) and, recently, a series of road regulations have been issued contextual to the substantial redevelopment of the public space of via Dante, with the aim of reducing the impacts of vehicular traffic in the most precious areas of the center. Finally, measures regarding the regulation of the parking system are being studied, in the hypothesis of an incremental implementation.  Promoting ""intelligent"" accessibility to the historic centre of Rovereto, which reduces the strong pressure of cars throughout the central area, both in terms of traffic and the employment of parking areas, is one of the more challenging topics of the Piano Urbano della Mobilit√† The contribution of the study of mobility consists in finding solutions to make the historical centres ""intelligently accessible"", gathering the challenge of keeping services and commercial activities competitive with those organized according to modern paradigms, for example in shopping malls, making them less accessible from the motorized private vehicle without this being a disincentive.In other words, our aim is not only in the concern to ""keep out"" the ""unsustainable"" mobility, which implies a ""passive"" attitude of protection, but instead in the desire to ""bring in"" flows of mobility into conditions of greater sustainability, environmental first, but increasingly also social. This requires an ""active"" positive approach, especially in the plaaces exposed to the risk of commercial decline.The urban realities that succeed in doing this can create the conditions for achieving excellent results not only in terms of reduction of vehicular traffic and consequent negative externalities (atmospheric and acoustic pollution, accidents, land occupation), but also in terms of enhancing the economic and commercial fabric of cities and improving the conditions of security, livability and well-being of the citizens. The process is not free from social conflicts and in many cases raises the opposition of some of the economic activities. For these characteristics it is well calibrated and studied in its operative phase.The participants are invited to make proposals, considerations and suggestions on initiatives, measures and ways to better manage these conflicts, to enhance and highlight the positive aspects linked to the increase in public spaces available to pedestrians and citizens in the city centre, to limit and mitigate any real or perceived kickbacks. Examples of elements that can characterize the approach are: communication and information on data, sharing of good practices adopted in other places, animation initiatives for the city centre, cross-sectoral projects, empowerment of stakeholders in relation to the general objectives of mobility (primarily economic activities and residents), enhancement of services.

Future transit of millions of people and increased movement needs of residents into the valleys, will imply new plans of integrated modal transport.   The construction works of the new Brenner Base gallery should be ended in 2027. The Brenner Tunnel will be made by two single-track tunnels, that will link Fortezza (in Italy) to Innsbruck (in Austria). The Tunnel will be used not only for goods but also for people. From 2027 onwards, after the Brenner Tunnel will be opened, Trentino will be more accessible for millions of people from Germany and Northern areas; space-time distances will be shortened considerably (only 4 hours will separate the farthest German areas from the Euregio and our main cities). After the Tunnel inauguration, the historical connection between Bolzano, Trento and Rovereto may become a bottleneck, with heavy criticalities. In fact, today, with less than 100 trains per day, Trento area crossed by the trains is full of criticalities and potential conflicts social and legal -noise, vibrations, etc.). In the future, this area could be crossed by 400 trains and transit through city will be unbearable, unless we move entire neighborhoods: that is why the theme of the access routes is not secondary but essential if we want the Tunnel to expand its full potential in the transfer of goods from the road to the rail (today Brenner Pass implements the lowest modal diversion between all the Alpine passes, that is less than 30% of the goods transported by rail, 70% on rubber). Access routes will not solve the Problem because, after accessing our region, German and Northern European citizens, once arrived here, will have to easily move in our valleys. Furthermore, how will our citizens move through the valleys throughout the year? Another import issue in the future will be ""sustainability"", which can not only meant as environmental but also economic (and not only investment but also management). For instance, large infrastructures could drain many financial resources to the management of capillar mobility services for extremely dispersed peripheral zones. Small house agglomerates, villages certainly surely benefit, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, in the extra-urban public transport service on wheels: it won‚Äôt be be demonized in favor of the rail service, but certainly assessed carefully weighting the negative and positive externalities.  Local public transport ‚ÄúTPL‚Äù (both on rail and on wheels) is not effective at 100% on an articulated Alpine territory like Trentino (featured by ""dispersed"" territory and population). Furthermore, in the near future transnational Brenner tunnel and access routes to our region will increase dramatically the people demand of transport. Specific policies governing the correct modal choice mix in terms of public rubber, railways, private rubber shall be created. These policies could include incentives to forms of light mobility and erosion of private mobility: for example, companies with more than 10 employees employ 80.000 peoples, and produce 150.000 travels/day: erosion of a 20% through forms of aid to light mobility (e.g.: bike routes) would imply 30.000 trips; providing 30.000 trips on the public transport means would imply an expense of at least 20-30 M‚Ç¨. Participants will work on solutions for universal transport in the internal areas of Trentino. Is it possible to optimize private means of transport as an alternative to TPL? A few ideas and proposals have been put on the plate: the creation of new local railways (Garda, Cembra Fiemme Fassa, the Dolomites railway along Valsugana,): to what extent will they be feasible? Will be our administration able to make all these local railways, whose cost is about 1,3 and 1,5 billion euros? Will be these railways the engine of sustainable mobility for the valleys for residents throughout the year? Bus passengers in Trentino amount to 47 million/year(intended as travelers on urban buses and suburban coaches, the latest totalling about 24 million out of 47). Passengers carried on the railway are 7,5 millions/year: that is passengers from the extra urban area (about 15 millions) are twice the number of passengers transported by the railway, with an expense that is much less than double for the bus service. Likewise, rail passengers per day, 22.000, is about half of the 45.000 passengers per days that use extra-urban buses. An integrated mobility policy should be based on the following three pillars: 1) railway mobility: for connections with large transport networks with the strengthening of the connecting stations of Trento and Rovereto; 2) public mobility ‚Äúon wheels"": for secondary connections; 3) private mobility ‚Äúon wheels"": for the last mile (plan for home-work movements, fostering bike use, carpool and car sharing).

Purchases of goods and service other than energy use and transportation adds up to 45% of NTNU‚Äôs total carbon footprint. We need more concrete solutions to reduce the impact from this category!    NTNU ‚Äì the Norwegian University of Science and Technology is the largest university in Norway, with 40,000 students, 7000 employees and an annual turnover of 9 billion NOK. It is currently divided into four separate campuses, of which two are located in Gj√∏vik and √Ölesund. In Trondheim, the social sciences and humanities at Dragvoll are soon moving closer to the city centre, together with the other parts of the university campus at Gl√∏shaugen, Kalvskinnet and √òya. This will be a large operation that puts its mark on the city development of Trondheim in the years to come. NTNU have four strategic research areas: Oceans, Health, Energy and Sustainability. NTNU Sustainability consists of several core partners from research environments that excel within the field of environmental sustainability. This include centres such as Zero Emission Neighbourhoods in Smart Cities (ZEN), Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD), Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies (CenSES) and various departments with relevant activity across NTNU. ‚ÄúTransition towards a circular economy and sustainable production and consumption systems‚Äù is one of the four focus areas of NTNU Sustainability. ¬† NTNU and Trondheim Municipality has had close cooperation throughout the years. This partnership was recently lifted to a strategic level and manifested in the University City agreement TRD 3.0. In July 2018, the +CityxChange¬†proposal under the ‚ÄúSmart Cities and Communities‚Äù call of the EU Horizon2020 programme got positive signal from the European Commission. ¬†This consortium was led by NTNU, with Trondheim as one of the two lighthouse cities. ""NTNU - Knowledge for a Better World"" NTNU has set high environmental ambition and aims to be the frontrunner who make use of knowledge from their research activities in its own practice to become an environmentally-friendly organisation. In Climathon Trondheim 2018, an unique partnership within NTNU is established, with representatives from NTNU Sustainability, NTNU‚Äôs Properties and Operation Dept. and Engage, Centre for Engaged Education through Entrepreneurship. The innovation process and its results shall expectedly be of interest for Trondheim Municipality and many more.  NTNU‚Äôs carbon footprint for 2017 was almost 100,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent. About 55% of this comes from energy use and transportation. For these categories there are several ongoing initiatives for reducing the climate impact. Here is an overview of NTNU's carbon footprint.¬† The remaining 45% is associated with NTNUs use of a myriad of different types of products and services. This spans from laboratory equipment to furnitures, IT-equipment, advisory services, waste treatment services etc. Here is a detailed breakdown of NTNU's carbon footprint. We need more efforts addressing this 45%-category of ‚Äúother goods and services‚Äù and believe that concepts and principals within ‚Äúcircular economy‚Äù could be useful. The term ‚Äúcircular economy‚Äù has become a popular buzzword in the environment scene the last few years. Lacking a unified and agreed-upon definition, the term is usually associated with facilitating sharing of resources, re-use and recycling to achieve constant level of function with lower total resource use. We‚Äôd like to invite students, researchers, citizens and entrepreneurs to join Climathon Trondheim 2018 and co-develop innovative strategies, tools, products, services or other initiatives that contribute to reduce carbon footprint from this challenging category.

In urban areas, the high exposure to risks deriving from climate change is also attributed to the concentration of people and economic assets, and the effects are more noticeable due to the combination of the various factors, such as increase in temperature and variation in the rainfall.¬†Moreover, access to water risks becoming increasingly difficult to guarantee, also due to climate change, especially in urban areas. Despite the increasingly evident situation, this fundamental resource is still being wasted. For example, in Italy in 2015, 38% of the water injected into the distribution networks was lost, with total losses that could meet the annual demand of 10 million people.¬† in addition to infrastructural requalification, it is necessary to reduce the consumption of drinking water: Italy, with 241 litres per inhabitant per year, ranks first in Europe for per capita consumption, and only a small part of this share is recovered and reused. About the massive uses that are made at the agricultural and industrial level the percentages of use of water resources are globally unequivocal: agriculture 60%, industry and commercial users 30%, drinking water 10%. In Piedmont Region, the ARPA data show that it is now evident that global warming has caused effects on temperatures and changes in the precipitation regime, both on temporal variability and extreme events, and on long-term trends. The maximum temperatures have risen by almost 2¬∞ C in 60 years, more markedly in mountain areas and, in the last 10-15 years, record years are still recorded with high temperatures emphasized by heat waves of anomalous summer heat of particular intensity and mild winters. ¬† ¬†  Below you will find some examples of possible solutions.

MONITORING AND PREVENTION  Develop integrative monitoring systems in order to observe the territory at a more detailed scale, also through the use of the IoT; Define tools for the identification and management of the ""relevant planning areas"" for the purpose of climate adaptation, also by assessing the degrees of vulnerability (vulnerability assessment) and the related priorities of action (climate change risk assessment); Define preventive and supplementary measures and alert measures to help mitigate the effects of extreme events; Develop new forms of communication in emergency, also through APP and social media; Develop new methods of participatory management of public spaces; Propose structured interventions both on the urban scale and on the building Develop urban planning tools and measures aimed at defining methodologies, techniques and intervention criteria for the construction, recovery, transformation, planning of green spaces and public spaces, aimed at improving the quality of urban environments in relation to climate changes.  SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES  Promote a trans-disciplinary and multisectoral approach in the management of the resource by integrating the scientific, technological, socio-economic, environmental and health aspects; Plan the sustainable use of water resources based on community needs, national development strategies and possible scenarios of climate change; Prepare, evaluate and implement economically and socially sustainable projects and programs on the basis of broad public participation; Identify, implement and strengthen appropriate socio-institutional, regulatory and financial mechanisms to ensure that water policies and their implementation are a focal point for social progress and economic growth.  We can also intervene through good practices that encourage:  ""Tap"" water consumption; Monitoring of consumption, also with the help of the new Internet of Things technologies; Optimization of consumption, for example by reducing the ""water footprint""; water reuse.  RESILIENCE  Adapt the civil protection tools to the actual needs of the population and the territory; Educate to self-protection and acceptance of residual risk that can not be eliminated; Promote knowledge of the territory; Make the citizen an active part of the actions to protect the territory; To encourage participatory management of common assets (example: River contracts).

How can new business models and technologies contribute to the management of energy use to better meet this fluctuating power supply?   In decentralised energy systems electrical generation and storage is performed by a variety of small, grid-connected devices referred to as distributed energy resources (DER). These are located close to the load they serve and typically use renewable energy sources. DER can be operated by either commercial providers (e.g. small hydro or wind power plants) or private households and businesses that feed surplus energy from their local photovoltaic or geothermal system etc. to the public grid. So far, this form of energy production by consumers (‚Äúprosuming‚Äù) still is at an early development stage and the required legal framework as well as technical prerequisites like smart meters are only gradually being rolled-out. Nonetheless, growing consumer interest and the need for decarbonisation/diversification of the energy system are strong drivers that will transform the energy system and pose a challenge to transmission system operators (typically public monopolies). In 2025, up to 20 % of electricity customers could be ‚Äúprosumers‚Äù. This will boost the need for matching the increasingly volatile energy supply with current demand patterns.   How can individual energy demand in cities be flexibly adjusted to fluctuating energy production and grid load from renewable sources, so that overall energy efficiency and carbon intensity can be optimised? Which new business models and innovative technologies could be provided and/or used by small businesses, private service providers, municipal grid operators, and citizens to flexibly consume energy in times of vast supply or provide energy in case of high demand? The Climathon teams should work out probable consequences businesses and grid operators in the city will face in the context of these developments and put together suggestions on how to respond by technical, organisational and/or business adjustments. This could be an elaborated and pre-formulated concept or the development of a prototype (visualisation, mock-up, click-dummy, etc.). Solutions should focus on:  Incentive systems to influence consumer behaviour (e.g. by dynamic price setting, control signals, sharing models, etc.) Smart distribution systems for the carbon-efficient management of energy sypply and demand Smart feed-in and energy trading systems for prosumers Real-time management systems for energy demand taking into account current feed-in volumes  ¬† This challenge is hosted by MunichRe and ERGO.

This results in delayed journeys, air and even sound pollution. Join us for a global #Climathon movement, solve the challenge, travel across Vilnius and help us find more efficient and green ways to commute.   The rapid economic development since Lithuania has become a part of the European Union has resulted in an average increase in salaries of by 39% in the year 2007-2017 - the best result across OECD members. Many citizens could afford various consumer products for the first time in their lives that were widely used in the West - including a personal vehicle. The current statistics published by Vilnius city authorities say that currently, the city has 0.87 vehicles for every 18-60-year-old citizen. Even worse, it is expected that there will be 1 vehicle per capita by the year 2021. There is no surprise that the municipality struggles to deal with such a growth of personal vehicles as most infrastructural projects take longer time and are very expensive. This results in traffic jams and longer, less efficient journeys as well as both air and noise pollution. How can we tackle the problem of cars and adjust our daily traveling needs for a smoother, greener and, maybe more social journeys across Vilnius.  How can we tackle the problem of privately owned cars in Vilnius city and fight the ever growing delays, air and noise pollution?

We face huge challenges in New Zealand and the world around reducing the emissions associated with the food system. In New Zealand agriculture is estimated to contribute to nearly half of all emissions due to factors including the methane produced by ruminants such as dairy cows. We do not see this reflected in Wellington‚Äôs carbon footprint as by and large, food is not produced within the city‚Äôs boundaries. However we are a city of over 200 000 people who eat, and as consumers we drive demand for certain kinds of food over other kinds. Local food movements (Local Food Week is an example here in Wellington) have sought to promote local, seasonal food and shorten supply chains. A note of caution, however, that the local food option is not always the lowest emission option (for example wheat doesn‚Äôt grow particularly well in the greater Wellington area) - nor is it always the healthiest. Food insecurity is only predicted to increase with climate change and the increased frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. Modelling indicates the likelihood of events which lead to a loss of 10% of global food production are now quite foreseeable ‚Äì or three times more likely. A loss in production (particularly when it coincides with depleted food stocks) can lead to price spikes and civil unrest in the most food insecure parts of the world (where people spend a very high proportion of their income on food). However given the extensive globalisation of the food system, disruption (e.g. in prices and availability) can be felt even in (relatively) food secure places such as New Zealand. While New Zealand is a high income country overall, and is a producer of so much food, local prices are high ‚Äì with the recent Otago University food survey showing that the weekly cost of healthy food comes to 42% of the minimum wage in Auckland (anything over 30% is a concern). Lastly, Wellington City is currently vulnerable due to lack of food suppliers and distributors within the city‚Äôs boundaries. We are reliant on the wider region to supply our food, but with the increasingly likelihood of adverse weather events due to climate change, are more likely to be cut off from such supplies.  While there are vibrant networks of people and organisations in Wellington taking action to transform the food system ‚Äì creating community gardens, food waste initiatives, farmers markets and increasing interest in local and seasonal food - much work remains to be done.¬† We‚Äôd like to leave you with some key challenges and opportunities for Wellington to not only address the climate impact of the food system, but to make the most of climate change mitigation efforts.  Are we doing enough to address overconsumption and the carbon footprint of our diet? What is the potential for expanding local food production through urban farming in Wellington? As the population in our City grows and intensifies, what can we do to make the best use of land available for growing ‚Äì and embed food sustainability in our City? Are there opportunities enhance the sustainability of our food systems through climate change mitigation efforts ‚Äì for example to include edibles in ‚Äúgreen‚Äù infrastructure and water sensitive design to cool our city and make it more resilient? How could our food supply chains be more carefully designed ‚Äì to reduce our carbon footprint and increase sustainability? Could we do more to increase our rates of food rescue and recovery?

It is time to prepare for the effects of climate change and for this, citizens and traders have an important role to play.   This summer, Wuppertal and many other cities in Germany have been hit by heavy rain. Roads were flooded, in many homes and shops the water was many inches high, the roof of a university building and a gas station collapsed. The costs caused by the storm are considerable. The prevention of floodings and heavy rainfall events and the resulting consequences is a communal task. It serves to protect potentially affected areas such as people, buildings, traffic, the economy, etc. and to avoid costly damages. Municipalities, water management associations and fire departments are also increasingly under pressure, as well as responsible, just like the private sector and local citizens.  There are numerous information materials for citizens and shops. Yet: many homeowners and also the industry ignore the warnings and continue to refrain from the simplest protective measures, such as backflow prevention devices in house connection lines. After heavy rain or a flood, awareness is naturally the highest among decision-makers, as well as the public, but it decreases soon afterwards, often to the point of ignoring the issues entirely. Questions to be answered are:  How can citizens (but also industry) be sensitized and motivated to not only be aware of the topic but also to do something about it? What are innovative and creative ways to inform affected population groups? How do citizens want to be involved in the planning and implementation of measures in the context of heavy rainrisk management?

For this purpose, an aqua-ponic farm will be created, which ensures a sustainable production through closed resource cycles. Products will be fish, vegetables, herbs, shellfish and insects. In order to operate a sustainable farm, besides a sustainable production process, it is important to develop and establish sustainable solutions for packaging as well.  In order to operate a sustainable farm, the solutions for the following three fields need to be climate-friendly and as garbage-free as possible:  Sales packaging of various fresh foods for selling in a shop Outer packaging for storage and preservation of food by production surplus Transport packaging of food for climate-neutral transport systems  The legal regulations for foods such as hygiene and cooling and the possibilities of climate-neutral logistics have to be considered.

In many cities, for example, proof of one car parking space per housing unit is still required. What happens to these areas if the requirements in our neighbourhoods are completely different after the switch to e-mobility and car and bike sharing?  How can the use of parking areas be adapted to the changing requirements of society and the neighbourhood in the areas of mobility, energy supply and social services?
